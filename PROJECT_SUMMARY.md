- **Pattern Matching**: Custom crime patterns and phrases
- **Context Analysis**: Understands relationships between entities
- **Text Cleaning**: Removes noise and formats data consistently

### Automation Options
1. **Windows Task Scheduler**: Professional-grade scheduling
2. **Built-in Scheduler**: Python-based scheduling with live monitoring
3. **Manual Execution**: On-demand scraping and testing

## 📊 Data Output Format

The system creates a CSV file with the following structure:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| date_scraped | When the article was processed |
| article_url | Original article URL |
| headline | Article headline |
| publication_date | When the article was published |
| who | People involved (victims, suspects) |
| what | Type of crime committed |
| where | Location of the incident |
| when | Date/time of the incident |
| how | Method or weapons used |
| why | Motivation or reason |
| economic_loss | Monetary losses mentioned |
| injuries | Number of people injured |
| fatalities | Number of deaths |
| arrests | Number of arrests made |
| full_text | Complete article text |

## 🛠️ Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Test installation
python test_installation.py

# Test configuration
python main.py --mode test

# Run full scrape
python main.py --mode full

# View statistics
python main.py --mode stats
```

### Automation Setup
```bash
# Windows batch automation
setup_automation.bat

# PowerShell automation (as Administrator)
.\automation.ps1 -Action create-task -Schedule daily -Time 09:00

# Built-in scheduler
python scheduler.py --schedule daily --time 09:00
```

```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adding New Websites
Edit `config.py` and add website configurations:

```python
NEWS_WEBSITES = [
    {
        "name": "Local News Site",
        "url": "https://localnews.com/crime",
        "article_selector": "article h2 a",
        "headline_selector": "h1.title",
        "content_selector": "div.content p"
    }
]
```

### Customizing Crime Keywords
Modify the crime detection by updating:

```python
CRIME_KEYWORDS = [
    "robbery", "theft", "murder", "assault",
    # Add more crime-related terms
]
```

## 📈 Scalability Features
