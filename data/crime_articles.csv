(Aurora Police Department via AP, File) DENVER (AP) — Just days before she died after suffering symptoms that mystified her doctors, Angela Craig confronted her husband, James, in their suburban Denver kitchen over his lack of support. In that 2023 argument captured on home surveillance video, she accused him of suggesting to hospital staff that she was suicidal, court documents show. Prosecutors say James Craig caused the ailments that ultimately killed his wife by poisoning her protein shakes and trying to make it look as if she killed herself. His trial on murder and other charges is set to begin Monday with the questioning of potential jurors. Angela Craig, 43, died in March 2023 during her third trip to the hospital that month. Toxicology tests later determined she died of poisoning from cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, an ingredient that is found in over-the-counter eye drops. The couple were married 23 years and had six children. Craig has pleaded not guilty to charges including first-degree murder, solicitation to commit murder and solicitation to commit perjury. The 47-year-old dentist allegedly bought arsenic online around the time his wife began to experience symptoms like dizziness and headaches for which doctors could find no cause, prosecutors say. At the time of his arrest, police said Craig was trying to start a new life amid financial troubles and appeared to be having an affair with a fellow dentist. Prosecutors said he had affairs with two other women, but they have not detailed a motive in his wife’s death. Craig’s attorneys have argued police were biased against him and claimed testing of his wife’s shake containers did not turn up signs of poison. They’ve questioned the reliability of a jail inmate who said Craig offered him $20,000 to kill the case’s lead investigator, an alleged plot for which Craig is also on trial. To avoid being held accountable, prosecutors said, Craig tried to fabricate evidence to make it appear his wife killed herself. He tried to get another fellow inmate to plant fraudulent letters at Craig’s home to make it look like his wife was suicidal, prosecutors said. Then, in the weeks before Craig had been set to stand trial in November, prosecutors said he also sent letters to the ex-wife of the inmate he allegedly tried to get to kill the investigator, offering her $20,000 for each person she could find to falsely testify that his wife planned to die by suicide, they said. As jury selection was about to begin, his lawyer at the time, Harvey Steinberg, asked to withdraw, citing a rule allowing lawyers to step down if a client persists in actions considered criminal or that they disagree with. Another attorney for Craig, Robert Werking, later argued that investigators did not look into whether Craig wrote the letters or check them against his handwriting. Werking also said that the inmate and his ex-wife were prosecuted for forgery for their roles in an alleged fraud ring in 2005, suggesting they could not be trusted. Werking withdrew from the case himself this month after being charged with arson of his own home, leaving his wife and law partner, Lisa Fine Moses, to defend Craig. Werking’s attorney, David Beller, said he was getting mental health treatment and asked the public to show him grace. Moses did not immediately return telephone and email messages seeking comment. Over the objections of the defense, prosecutors plan to show the video of the argument in the kitchen to jurors. “It’s your fault they treated me like I was a suicide risk, like I did it to myself, and like nothing I said could be believed,” Angela Craig told her husband after her first trip to the hospital. Prosecutors convinced the judge jurors should see the video because they said it disproves potential claims that Angela Craig poisoned herself — possibly while trying to dissuade him from divorcing her — or to frame him and gain an advantage over him if they did divorce. “Her mental state is anger and frustration, not suicidality or desperation to keep the defendant in the marriage,” Senior Chief Deputy District Attorney Michael Mauro wrote in a recent court filing. One of Angela Craig’s siblings, Mark Pray, said last year that James Craig not only orchestrated the “torment and demise” of his sister but had shown disregard for others, including their children. Prosecutors say James Craig searched online for answers to questions such as “how to make murder look like a heart attack” and “is arsenic detectable in an autopsy?” After Craig’s initial attempts to kill his wife failed, prosecutors allege, he ordered a rush shipment of potassium cyanide, supposedly for surgery. The shipment was accidentally discovered by an employee at his dental practice in the Denver suburb of Aurora on March 13, 2023. The employee reported it to the office manager two days later when Angela Craig returned to the hospital for a third and final time. Craig’s business partner, Ryan Redfearn, told a nurse treating Angela Craig that he was concerned she could have been poisoned with the cyanide. The nurse reported that to police, who began their investigation the same day. Angela Craig died days later. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombian authorities said Friday they captured an alleged leader of the Italian ’ndrangheta mafia in Latin America who is accused of overseeing cocaine shipments and managing illegal trafficking routes to Europe. Police identified the suspect as Giuseppe Palermo, also known as “Peppe,” an Italian who was wanted under an Interpol red notice, which called for his arrest in 196 countries. He was apprehended on the street in Colombia’s capital Bogota during a coordinated operation between Colombian, Italian and British authorities, as well as Europol, the European Union’s law enforcement agency, according to an official report. Palermo is believed to be part of “one of the most tightly knit cells” of the ’ndrangheta mafia, said Carlos Fernando Triana, head of the Colombian police, in a message posted on X. The ’ndrangheta, one of Italy’s most powerful and secretive criminal organizations, has extended its influence abroad and is widely accused of importing cocaine into Europe. The suspect “not only led the purchase of large shipments of cocaine in Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador, but also controlled the maritime and land routes used to transport the drugs to European markets,” Triana added. Illegal cocaine production reached 3,708 tons in 2023, an increase of nearly 34% from the previous year, driven mainly by the expansion of coca leaf cultivation in Colombia, according to the United Nations.

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II, File) MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Professional boxer Gervonta “Tank” Davis was arrested early Friday morning in South Florida on a misdemeanor domestic violence charge. Davis, 30, was picked up shortly after midnight near the popular Lincoln Road area of Miami Beach, officials said. The charge was connected to an incident that occurred last month in Doral, a residential city in western Miami-Dade, Miami Beach police spokesperson Christopher Bess said. Davis and his vehicle information had been added to a law enforcement database, and a license plate reader set up in Miami Beach flagged his car. Miami Beach police made the initial stop and then turned Davis over to Doral police, Bess said. Davis was being held on $10,000 bail. Jail and court records didn’t list an attorney for Davis. His promoter didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Davis, who is from Baltimore, is in the regular conversation for best pound-for-pound boxer. The WBA lightweight champion won his first 30 bouts, 28 by knockout, with his devastating punching power drawing sellouts crowds from New York to Washington to Las Vegas. But Davis was booed during his most recent fight. Despite being an overwhelming favorite, he underperformed March 1 in Brooklyn’s Barclays Center but escaped with a majority draw against Lamont Roach that allowed Davis to retain his belt. Referee Steve Willis’ decision not to award Roach a knockdown in the ninth round ultimately changed the fight’s outcome. Whether that performance was a one-off for Davis or an indication of a declining fighter, crowds still likely will turn out to see Davis if and when he returns to the ring after his most recent legal trouble. He was sentenced to 90 days of house arrest for a hit-and-run in November 2020 in Baltimore that injured several people. Davis eventually served the remainder of the sentence in jail after checking into a luxury hotel and then a new home without the court’s permission. Davis also was charged in two other domestic violence cases, both in South Florida. The first case was discharged, according to ESPN. The second was dismissed after the woman refused to press charges. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The Paris prosecutor’s office, in a statement Friday, announced the opening of the investigation, and said that a branch of the French gendarmerie is conducting the inquiry. The investigation is looking into two alleged offenses “in particular” — organized tampering with the functioning of an automated data processing system, and organized fraudulent extraction of data from an automated data processing system, the statement said. It didn’t give details of the alleged wrongdoing. It said that the investigation is targeting both the platform and people, without naming them or saying what role they might have within X. The prosecutor’s office said that it was acting on information that two people provided in January to its cybercrimes unit. One of them is a member of parliament, and the other is a senior official in a French government institution. It didn’t identify them or the institution. It said the two people alleged the suspected use of X’s algorithm for the “purposes of foreign interference.” It didn’t detail the alleged interference or how the algorithm was allegedly used. The prosecutor’s office said that it decided this week to open the police investigation, after conducting its own “verifications” and having received additional information from French researchers and “various public institutions.” The Associated Press has emailed X’s press office, seeking comment. ___ Kelvin Chan contributed to this report from London.

All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. TEHRAN (AP) — An Israeli airstrike on Iran’s capital last month killed five inmates at Evin prison and resulted in the escape of several others, Iranian media reported Saturday. The semi-official ILNA news agency and other Iranian media quoted a spokesman for Iran’s judiciary that the five inmates killed in the June 23 strike had been convicted on financial offences. The spokesman didn’t name the victims or give any further details. The judiciary’s own news website, Mizanonline quoted spokesman Asghar Jahangir as saying only that “small number” of inmates were killed. He added that an “insignificant number of inmates” had also escaped and that authorities would soon bring them back into custody. Jahangir said no one serving time at Evin prison for working with Israel’s spy agency Mossad was injured in the attack. Iranian authorities last month put the death toll from the air strike at 71. But Iranian media later raised that number to 80 including staff, soldiers, inmates and visiting family members. It’s unclear why Israel targeted the prison. The Israeli Defense Ministry had said on the day of the airstrikes that 50 aircraft dropped 100 munitions on military targets “based on high-quality and accurate intelligence from the Intelligence Branch.” The New York-based Center for Human Rights had criticized Israel for striking the prison - seen as a symbol of repression of any opposition - saying it violated the principle of distinction between civilian and military targets. The 12-day air war left more than 1,060 dead in Iran and 28 dead in Israel. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP) — A 26-year-old woman has been arraigned in the fatal stabbing of her manager after being told to leave early from her shift following an argument at a Detroit-area McDonald’s restaurant. Afeni Badu Muhammad was arraigned Friday on first-degree premeditated murder and carrying a dangerous weapon with unlawful intent, the Macomb County prosecutor’s office said in a release. After being told to leave the Eastpointe restaurant Thursday morning, a masked Muhammad allegedly returned and entered through the employee entrance, according to the prosecutor’s office. Eastpointe is just northeast of Detroit. Jennifer Harris, 39, was stabbed multiple times. A customer at the McDonald’s drive-thru window fired a gun in an effort to stop the attack on Harris, followed Muhammad as she fled to a vehicle and held her at gunpoint until police arrived. The customer was legally allowed to carry a concealed weapon. “This is an absolutely senseless and heartbreaking tragedy,” Prosecutor Peter Lucido said. “A life was taken in an act of unimaginable violence. The victim leaves behind six children, six young lives that will now grow up without a parent.” Muhammad, of Eastpointe, was being held in the Macomb County Jail on a $25 million bond. A not guilty plea was entered by a judge at Friday’s arraignment, according to court records. “There are a lot of things that need to come to light regarding this matter,” Muhammad’s arraignment attorney Matthew Licata told The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — A divided federal appeals court on Friday threw out an agreement that would have allowed accused Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to plead guilty in a deal sparing him the risk of execution for al-Qaida’s 2001 attacks. The decision by a panel of the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., undoes an attempt to wrap up more than two decades of military prosecution beset by legal and logistical troubles. It signals there will be no quick end to the long struggle by the U.S. military and successive administrations to bring to justice the man charged with planning one of the deadliest attacks ever on the United States. The deal, negotiated over two years and approved by military prosecutors and the Pentagon’s senior official for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a year ago, stipulated life sentences without parole for Mohammed and two co-defendants. Mohammed is accused of developing and directing the plot to crash hijacked airliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Another of the hijacked planes flew into a field in Pennsylvania. Relatives of the Sept. 11 victims were split on the plea deal. Some objected to it, saying a trial was the best path to justice and to gaining more information about the attacks, while others saw it as the best hope for bringing the painful case to a conclusion and getting some answers from the defendants. The plea deal would have obligated the men to answer any lingering questions that families of the victims have about the attacks. But then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin repudiated the deal, saying a decision on the death penalty in an attack as grave as Sept. 11 should only be made by the defense secretary. Attorneys for the defendants had argued that the agreement was already legally in effect and that Austin, who served under President Joe Biden, acted too late to try to throw it out. A military judge at Guantanamo and a military appeals panel agreed with the defense lawyers. But, by a 2-1 vote, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found Austin acted within his authority and faulted the military judge’s ruling. The panel had previously put the agreement on hold while it considered the appeal, first filed by the Biden administration and then continued under President Donald Trump. “Having properly assumed the convening authority, the Secretary determined that the ‘families and the American public deserve the opportunity to see military commission trials carried out.’ The Secretary acted within the bounds of his legal authority, and we decline to second-guess his judgment,” judges Patricia Millett and Neomi Rao wrote. Millett was an appointee of President Barack Obama while Rao was appointed by Trump. In a dissent, Judge Robert Wilkins, an Obama appointee, wrote, “The government has not come within a country mile of proving clearly and indisputably that the Military Judge erred.” Brett Eagleson, who was among the family members who objected to the deal, called Friday’s appellate ruling “a good win, for now.” “A plea deal allows this to be tucked away into a nice, pretty package, wrapped into a bow and put on a shelf and forgotten about,” said Eagleson, who was 15 when his father, shopping center executive John Bruce Eagleson, was killed in the attacks. Brett Eagleson was unmoved by the deal’s provisions for the defendants to answer Sept. 11 families’ questions; he wonders how truthful the men would be. In his view, “the only valid way to get answers and seek the truth is through a trial” and pretrial fact-finding. Elizabeth Miller, who was 6 when the attacks killed her father, firefighter Douglas Miller, was among those who supported the deal. “Of course, growing up, a trial would have been great initially,” she said. But “we’re in 2025, and we’re still at the pretrial stage.” “I just really don’t think a trial is possible,” said Miller, who also favored the deal because of her opposition to the death penalty in general. ___ Peltz reported from New York. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks at https://apnews.com/hub/september-11-attacks.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay) BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — An event in support of local reporting was postponed after death threats against a journalist for his newspaper editorial cartoon about the catastrophic flooding in Texas, according to a union. An online fury erupted this week over an editorial cartoon in The Buffalo News by Pulitzer Prize-winner Adam Zyglis showing a man in a MAGA cap being swept away by the Texas floodwaters. Nose deep in the water, the man is holding up a sign that reads “Help” and a speech bubble floating downstream says: “Gov’t is the problem not the solution.” At least 120 people were killed in the Texas flooding and more than 170 were missing. The Buffalo Newspaper Guild said a happy hour event Thursday at the Buffalo History Museum called “Drawing Support for Local Journalism” was postponed amid the backlash. The free, public event was planned to highlight the need for local journalism at a museum exhibit of Zyglis’ work. But the guild said plans to protest and confront Zyglis at the event led to death threats against the cartoonist “and a deluge of other direct threats to hurt him and his family.” “We wholly condemn the individuals who have chosen to twist a positive, public event into an attempt to terrorize and silence Zyglis, spread fear among journalists and their supporters, and distort the mission of a free press,” the guild said in an online post. Zyglis posted the guild announcement on Instagram and commented: “Threats to me and my family are never an acceptable response to disagreeing with an editorial cartoon.” The guild said the event will be rescheduled.

Opposition figure Kalonzo Musyoka said the president’s order was “against the constitution” and that he should “resign or be impeached.” President William Ruto said on Wednesday that he would not allow “anarchy” in the country disguised as peaceful demonstrations, and called for police to shoot and “break the legs” of those found looting or damaging property during protests. Human rights groups have called for restraint among police officers as waves of protests have rocked Kenya in recent weeks. More than 50 people have died in the two major demonstrations, according to the state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. The unrest began when the death of a blogger in police custody last month angered many Kenyans, and tensions heightened after the shooting of the civilian, Boniface Kariuki. Kariuki was selling face masks to protesters during an anti-police brutality demonstration on June 17 when two officers appeared to confront him and shot him in the head as he walked away. On Thursday, an officer was charged with his murder. A plea hearing for the officer is set for July 28. Thousands turned out for protests on June 25, which coincided with the one-year anniversary of huge anti-tax protests. At Kariuki’s burial in Githunguri, Murang’a county, his body arrived in a white coffin draped with a Kenyan flag and a photo showing the moment he was shot was placed next to it. Young people danced around the coffin while waving a Kenyan flag. No uniformed police officers were observed at the burial venue, but antiriot police remained deployed around Murang’a town. Murang’a County Governor Irungu Kang’ata said local leaders would ensure justice is served. “The government must take responsibility for the killing of Boniface,” he said. Several mothers of the more than 100 young people who have died in protests since last year’s anti-tax demonstrations were present at the burial. Four police officers are currently in custody over the recent deaths of young people and are facing murder charges in court. Three officers were last month charged with the death of blogger Albert Ojwang in custody. Police had said he died after repeatedly banging his head on a wall, but a postmortem report stated that the injuries were not self-inflicted. Another officer, Klinzy Barasa, on Thursday appeared in court where prosecution approved murder charges against him. He is expected to submit a plea on July 28. ——- Musambi reported from Nairobi, Kenya Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(Rescue 1122 Emergency Department via AP) Gunmen in southwestern Pakistan abducted and killed nine people after stopping two passenger buses on a highway Thursday night, officials said. The overnight attacks occurred in the Zhob and Loralai districts of Balochistan province as the buses traveled from the provincial capital, Quetta, to Punjab province, district administrator Saadat Husain said Friday. The attackers fled the scene and a search is underway to track down the assailants. Authorities recovered the bodies along the highway, Husain said. Ashfaq Chaudhry, an administrator in Punjab’s Dera Ghazi Khan district, said the attackers appeared to target passengers from Punjab specifically. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the abduction and killings of the bus passengers. Pakistan’s President Asif Ali Zardari issued a statement condemning the “brutal killing of passengers” in Balochistan. He blamed the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army for the deaths and said the group wanted to “spread chaos and instability in Pakistan.” The BLA killed 23 passengers in Balochistan in a similar attack last year. However, the militant group issued a statement saying on Thursday night it was engaged in an attack on a military camp in Balochistan’s Surab district, far away from the areas of the bus attacks. Baluchistan has been the scene of a long-running insurgency in southwestern Pakistan with an array of separatist groups, including the BLA, demanding independence from Pakistan’s central government in Islamabad. The groups have staged attacks mainly targeting security forces and people from Punjab who travel to Balochistan for business or employment. Although Pakistani authorities say they have quelled the insurgency, violence in the province has persisted. The Pakistani government has routinely blamed India for backing the Pakistani Taliban and Baloch insurgents in Pakistan. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

This frame grab from video, provided by the Mexican government, shows Ovidio Guzman Lopez being detained in Culiacan, Mexico, Oct. 17, 2019. (CEPROPIE via AP File) CHICAGO (AP) — A son of notorious Mexican drug kingpin “El Chapo” pleaded guilty Friday to U.S. drug trafficking charges, becoming the first of the drug lord’s sons to enter a plea deal. Prosecutors allege Ovidio Guzman Lopez and his brother, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, ran a faction of the Sinaloa cartel. They became known locally as the “Chapitos,” or “little Chapos,” and federal authorities in 2023 described the operation as a massive effort to send “staggering” quantities of fentanyl into the U.S. As part of a plea agreement, Ovidio Guzman Lopez admitted to helping oversee the production and smuggling of large quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the United States, fueling a crisis that has contributed to tens of thousands of overdose deaths annually. Guzman Lopez pleaded guilty to drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms charges tied to his leadership role in the cartel. Terms of the deal, including sentencing recommendations or cooperation agreements, were not immediately disclosed. Speculation about a deal had percolated for months, as behind-the-scenes negotiations quietly progressed. Jeffrey Lichtman, an attorney for the two brothers, said Friday he would wait until Ovidio Guzman Lopez was sentenced before discussing whether the agreement was a good deal. Guzman Lopez’s sentencing was postponed while he cooperates with U.S. authorities, as he agreed to do so on Friday. Whether he avoids a life in prison sentence depends on whether authorities say he has held up his end of the agreement. Lichtman said he didn’t know whether the case against Joaquin Guzman Lopez could be resolved with a plea deal, noting that it is “completely different.” “Remember, Joaquin was arrested in America well after Ovidio was, so it takes time,” he said. Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Law School and former assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, said that Guzman Lopez, by pleading guilty, may have “saved other family members.” “In this way, he has some control over who he’s cooperating against and what the world will know about that cooperation.” Levenson called the plea change a “big step” for the U.S. government and said Guzman Lopez could provide “a roadmap of how to identify members of the cartel.” “This is big,” she said. “The best way for them to take out the cartel is to find out about its operations from an insider, and that’s what they get from his cooperation.” Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Friday criticized the “lack of coherence” in American policy toward Mexican cartels, highlighting the disparity between the U.S. government declaring cartels foreign terrorist organizations, but also striking plea deals with their leaders. Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2019 for his role as the former leader of the Sinaloa cartel, having smuggled mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States over 25 years. The brothers allegedly assumed their father’s former role as leaders of the cartel. Ovidio Guzman Lopez was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the United States. He initially pleaded not guilty but had signaled in recent months his intent to change his plea. Joaquin Guzman Lopez and another longtime Sinaloa leader, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, were arrested in July 2024 in Texas after they landed in the U.S. on a private plane. Both men have pleaded not guilty to multiple charges. Their dramatic capture prompted a surge in violence in Mexico’s northern state of Sinaloa as two factions of the Sinaloa cartel clashed. ___ Associated Press writer Megan Janetsky contributed from Mexico City.

(AP Photo/Marco Ugarte) MEXICO CITY (AP) — It started with a phone call to a men’s clothing store in the heart of Mexico City’s historic center. “I need you to put together 10,000 pesos ($500) for me weekly, or else we’ll have to do something,” the voice said. The owner hung up and didn’t answer the phone again for days. But when another call came the following week, in a surge of courage and indignation the owner told the caller he wouldn’t pay, that the money demanded would have been half the store’s daily income. “Well, prepare to face the consequences,” the voice said. Several years of escalating threats, visits from goons and armed robberies followed until the shop owner, who requested anonymity because he still fears retaliation, decided to close the store his grandfather had opened in 1936. Extortion is strangling businesses in Mexico. Much, but not all, of it is linked to Mexico’s powerful organized crime groups. While some larger companies eat it as the cost of doing business, many smaller ones are forced to close. Pedestrians traverse Francisco I. Madero Avenue in downtown Mexico City, Thursday, July 10, 2025. (AP Photo/Fernando Llano) The Mexican Employers’ Association, Coparmex, says extortion cost businesses some $1.3 billion in 2023. And this year, while other major crimes are descending, extortion continues to rise, up 10% nationally in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. In Mexico City, the number of reported extortion cases nearly doubled in the first five months of 2025 to 498, up from 249 for the same period last year. It’s the highest total at this point in the year in the past six years, according to federal crime data. After the first call in 2019, the store owner had his employees stop answering the phone for eight months. Things quieted, but in early 2020, two men came to the shop and demanded payment. The owner pretended to be a shopper and slipped out. In 2021, the weekly calls demanding money in exchange for “security” resumed. Under advice of his attorneys, the owner eventually stopped going into the shop, instead managing everything remotely. In one of several robberies, his employees were held at gunpoint, tied up and locked in a bathroom, while the robbers took money from the cash register. Finally, after two years of threats and robberies, he reported it to authorities. Investigators demanded proof from him that he couldn’t provide because the threats were always verbal, he said. The investigation went nowhere. Mexico City police patrol a neighborhood in Mexico City, Wednesday, April 2, 2025. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte) Reported extortion cases are only a small fraction of the reality. Mexico’s National Institute for Statistics and Geography estimated that some 97% of extortion cases were not reported in 2023. Reporting is low because of a combination of fear and skepticism that authorities will do something. Mexico City Police Chief Pablo Vázquez Camacho said in an interview with AP that police were receiving more reports of extortion, but recognized that they still weren’t hearing about many more. “We can’t solve something that we’re not even seeing or that isn’t being reported,” Vázquez said. The problem, said Vicente Gutiérrez Camposeco, president of the Mexico City Chamber of Commerce, “has become entrenched” in Mexico and especially the capital in recent years. Daniel Bernardi, whose family has run a popsicle shop in the historic center for 85 years, was resigned to the situation. “There isn’t much to do,” he said. “You pay when you have to pay.” Last month, the Mexico City prosecutor’s office announced that it was creating a special prosecutor’s office to investigate and prosecute extortion. Mexico City’s Secretary of Security Pablo Vázquez Camacho gives an interview in his office in Mexico City, Wednesday, April 2, 2025. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte) In July, President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would propose legislation giving the government greater powers to pursue extortionists. This week, her administration also announced a national strategy to address extortion. There will be a phone number to anonymously report extortion; the power to immediately cancel phone numbers associated with extortion calls; local anti-extortion units to investigate cases and the involvement of Mexico’s Financial Intelligence Unit to freeze bank accounts associated with extortion. Nationally, extortion cases are up more than 6% on the year. Extortion’s rapid expansion has to do with the significant sums it generates for organized crime, drawing in the country’s most powerful drug cartels, among others. The Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels have made extortion “one of the divisions of their criminal portfolios,” said security analyst David Saucedo. And with the cartels involved, small-time crooks take advantage of the fear and run their own little extortion rackets, pretending to be associated with larger organized crime groups. The Mexico City men’s clothing store owner didn’t know who was extorting him. But without help from authorities, he felt alone and exposed. The threats had grown stronger and they now said they’d kill him if he didn’t pay. The owner recalled that a nearby restaurant that had opened around the same time as his own store, had closed after its owner was killed, supposedly after not paying extortion demands. So in December 2023, he saw no other option but to close. Little by little he watched old pieces of furniture carried out of the store that his father had passed on to him as his grandfather had passed it on to his father. “When I closed I felt very sad. And then it made me so mad to think that I could still go on, but because of fear I couldn’t,” he said. “You work your whole life for them to destroy it.” Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jennifer Kelleher, File) HONOLULU (AP) — A Native Hawaiian man who was convicted of a hate crime against a white man must be re-sentenced, a U.S. appeals court ruled Thursday, and the result could be several more years in prison. Kaulana Alo-Kaonohi was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in 2023 by a judge in Honolulu after a jury found him and another Native Hawaiian man guilty. The jury found that Alo-Kaonohi and Levi Aki Jr. were motivated by Christopher Kunzelman’s race when they punched, kicked and used a shovel to beat him in 2014 for trying to move into their remote Maui village. Alo-Kaonohi appealed the conviction, and prosecutors cross-appealed, challenging the judge’s conclusion that he could not apply the hate crime enhancement to the sentence. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel also ruled Thursday to affirm Alo-Kaonohi’s conviction. It was unclear exactly how much more time Alo-Kaonohi could get, but based on sentencing guidelines and the judge’s previous sentence, it could be up to three additional years, said Alexander Silvert, a retired federal defender in Honolulu who was not involved in the case. Alo-Kaonohi’s attorneys and prosecutors did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment on the ruling. Aki’s appeal, along with prosecutors’ cross-appeal of Aki’s sentence of about four years, were voluntarily dismissed, according to court records. Kunzelman’s wife, Lori Kunzelman, told AP Thursday that she is glad prosecutors pushed for a lengthier sentence. The Kunzelmans purchased a dilapidated, oceanfront house there sight-unseen for $175,000 because they wanted to leave Arizona after Lori Kunzelman’s multiple sclerosis diagnosis. “We had vacationed on Maui year after year — loved, loved, loved Maui,” she said, adding that they saw the home as an affordable opportunity that her husband could fix up. She said the beating of her husband “destroyed my marriage” and his brain injuries led them to go through a divorce. She said her husband was traveling in Europe and unavailable to comment on the ruling. They still own the property, she said, and do not know what to do with it. “The families there won’t allow anybody to step foot on that property,” she said. “There’s so much animosity.” The case highlighted struggles between Native Hawaiians who are adamant about not having their culture erased and people who move to the islands without knowing or considering its history and nuanced racial dynamics. Central to the case was the use of the word, “haole,” a Hawaiian word with meanings that include foreigner and white person. Dennis Kunzelman testified that the men called him “haole” in a derogatory way. Attorneys for Aki and Alo-Kaonohi said it was not Kunzelman’s race that provoked them but his entitled and disrespectful attitude. The Hawaii Innocence Project plans to take up the case, according to Kenneth Lawson, the organization’s co-director. It intends to argue that an ineffective defense did not present for the jury the history of the word “haole” in Hawaii and show it is not a derogatory term. “I just don’t believe that it’s a hate crime,” Lawson said. He also said the defense should have called as witnesses white, non-Hawaiian residents who would have testified that they lived in the village without any racial problems.

People walk by the Manhattan Criminal Court building, May 29, 2024, in New York. (AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Two men who went to prison as teenagers for a 1994 killing were exonerated Thursday, after prosecutors said new DNA testing and a fresh look at other evidence made it impossible to stand by the convictions. Brian Boles and Charles Collins served decades behind bars before they were paroled; Collins in 2017 and Boles just last year. They’re now free of the cloud of their convictions in the death of James Reid, an octogenarian who was attacked in his Harlem apartment. A judge scrapped the convictions and the underlying charges. Boles “lost three decades of his life for a crime he had nothing to do with,” said his lawyer Jane Pucher, who works with the Innocence Project. Collins’ lead lawyer, Christopher Conniff, said Thursday’s court action righted “a terrible injustice.” “While today’s order cannot return to him the 20-plus years he spent in prison, he is happy that his name is finally cleared,” said Conniff, who’s with the firm Ropes & Gray. A message was sent Thursday to a possible relative of Reid’s to seek comment on the developments. A maintenance worker found Reid, 85, beaten and apparently strangled with a telephone cord, after noticing the man’s apartment door was open, according to a New York Times report at the time. The apartment had been ransacked, according to the newspaper. Boles lived in the same building, and Collins was staying with him. The teens came under suspicion after they were arrested in a robbery about a week later. Collins and Boles gave confessions that their lawyers say were false and prompted by heavy-handed and threatening police interrogations. Boles recanted his admission before his trial, but he was convicted of murder; Collins subsequently pleaded guilty. Both were 17. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office now says the purported confessions were contradicted by witness statements indicating Reid was alive hours after the teens claimed he had been killed. The men’s trial lawyers and courts never got to see those statements. Nor were they given a lab report that undermined a detective’s testimony linking Collins to a footprint found at the crime scene. Bragg, a Democrat who wasn’t in office at the time, demurred Thursday when asked about officers’ conduct, instead faulting “the systems that were in place decades ago.” All the police and prosecutors who worked on the case likely retired or changed jobs years ago. While these old pieces of evidence proved to be problematic, new technology blew another hole in the case when prosecutors and defense lawyers reinvestigated it. A new round of DNA testing, using techniques unavailable in the 1990s, found that genetic material on Reid’s fingernails didn’t match Boles or Collins. It’s not clear whose DNA it is, and Bragg said for technical reasons, the sample can’t be fed into law enforcement databases to search broadly for a match there. But it could prove very helpful if a lead is developed in some other way, he said, urging anyone with any information to come forward. “The injustice had many dimensions,” Bragg said. “Mr. Boles and Mr. Collins — decades in prison. And a family that does not have closure. And a society that has someone at large amongst us for decades for a homicide that remains unsolved.” Boles, 48, took college classes in prison, earned a sociology degree this May and is building a career in working with marginalized people, his lawyers said. Lawyers for Collins, 49, didn’t shed light on his pursuits. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The conservative Caribbean country currently operates on a penal code dating from 1884, and efforts to reform it in the past 23 years have failed. “It’s a code that has many setbacks in terms of rights,” said Sergia Galván Ortega, with the Coalition for Women’s Lives and Rights. She joined the demonstrators on Thursday who demanded that abortion be allowed in cases of rape, incest or fatal fetal abnormalities. The Dominican Republic is currently one of only a handful of countries with an absolute abortion ban. Others include Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador. Thursday’s protest was especially important to some Dominicans given that the government cannot be held criminally responsible for the recent collapse of a nightclub’s roof that killed more than 230 people. While the nightclub’s owner and his sister were detained, many were outraged that the government cannot be held liable — not under the current or the proposed new penal code. Protesters also noted that the proposed penal code does not recognize marital rape and would allow physical violence against children if the adult does not demonstrate a pattern of aggression. It also calls for lesser prison time for child sex abuse cases with no penetration. “That’s terrible,” said Natalia Mármol, an activist and member of the women’s coalition. The proposed code was fast-tracked in commission and is expected to be approved by the Dominican Senate and Chamber of Deputies. It would then go to President Luis Abinader, who several years ago said he supports allowing abortion under certain circumstances. A decade ago, former President Danilo Medina vetoed a different proposed penal code, demanding that abortion be allowed under certain circumstances. Lawmakers amended the code, but a court eventually struck it down amid opposition from religious officials. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ivan Valencia, File) BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Assets worth over $64 million were seized and 94 people arrested as part of a multinational law enforcement operation targeting environmental crime in the Amazon Basin. The crackdown, coordinated by the United Arab Emirates, has struck a major blow to transnational environmental crime networks, officials said. The campaign, which ran from June 23 to July 6, mobilized more than 1,500 officers from Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Authorities conducted over 350 coordinated raids targeting illegal mining, wildlife trafficking, logging and fuel smuggling across some of the Amazon’s most remote and ecologically sensitive regions. Dubbed Operation Green Shield, the crackdown was coordinated by the UAE’s Ministry of Interior through the International Initiative of Law Enforcement for Climate (I2LEC), a platform launched in 2023 to support climate-related policing. A central command center was established in Colombia’s capital, Bogota, with real-time data sharing, officials said. “Environmental crime displaces communities, fuels violence against women and children, and erodes cultural heritage. These are not just crimes against nature — they are crimes against people,” Lt. Col. Dana Humaid, Director-General of the International Affairs Bureau at the UAE Ministry of Interior and Coordinator of I2LEC, told The Associated Press in a call. Humaid said countries worked closely to set shared priorities, ensuring the operation aligned with both national objectives and broader international goals. ¨That’s what made it different — it wasn’t top-down, it was a joint design and execution,” she said. Among the seizures were more than 310 tons of raw minerals, 3,800 cubic meters of timber, 39,000 gallons of smuggled fuel, and 530 pieces of equipment, including trucks and bulldozers. Authorities also recovered more than 2,100 live animals and 6,350 dead specimens — including birds, reptiles, and mammals — that were being trafficked through illegal wildlife networks. Raids and arrests took place simultaneously across a wide stretch of the Amazon, including Sarare Indigenous Land in Brazil’s Mato Grosso state, home to the Nambikwara people, and El Cenepa Province in Peru’s Amazonas region, where the Kumpanam Indigenous community resides, authorities said. In Brazil, authorities also deployed teams in Amapa state. In Colombia, operations were carried out in at least 22 departments, including Putumayo, Guaviare, Choco, Antioquia and Vichada. In Ecuador, law enforcement activity spanned dozens of locations from Carchi Province, home to the Awa Indigenous people, to Loja, Zamora, Santo Domingo and other provinces. One of the largest wildlife rescues occurred in Peru, where police recovered 1,400 live animals and dismantled a group known as Los Depredadores del Oriente, accused of trafficking endangered species. In Colombia, authorities said they disrupted three criminal groups and took down a cell allegedly linked to the Clan del Golfo, a powerful organized crime syndicate. Humaid said the operation demonstrated how international cooperation can be used to confront environmental crime and that in previous operations, like in the Congo Basin, it was a heritage issue. ¨In the Amazon, we’re seeing the same thing — these crimes directly impact Indigenous communities, their land, their livelihoods, and their identity.¨ The use of satellite-based geolocation tools allowed teams to coordinate across borders and monitor operations in real time, enabling what officials called one of the most synchronized environmental enforcement actions in the region to date. Colombian authorities described the operation as part of a broader national and international strategy. “We achieved real progress against illegal mining, fuel theft, and wildlife trafficking,” said Col. Jorge Andres Bernal Granada, director of environmental protection at Colombia’s National Police. Ecuador’s Deputy Police Commander Fausto Iñiguez Sotomayor called the country’s first participation in an I2LEC-led operation a “critical step,” while Gen. Manuel Elías Lozada Morales of Peru said the campaign proved that countries “can effectively protect one of the most important ecosystems on the planet.” Renato Madsen Arruda, Brazil’s federal coordinator for Amazon and environmental protection, said the work disrupted illegal gold mining operations in hard-to-reach areas. Officials said further arrests and seizures are likely as follow-up investigations continue. — Follow Steven Grattan on Instagram: @steven.grattan — The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigerian security forces have killed at least 30 gunmen after armed attacks in the country’s troubled northwest, authorities said Thursday. The joint police and military operation occurred Wednesday after hundreds of armed men attacked several villages, State Commissioner for Home Affairs Nasir Mua’zu said in a statement. Mua’zu said three police officers and two soldiers died during the counter-attack which was launched against the gunmen who attacked the villages Tuesday evening. “We are working tirelessly with federal security agencies to ensure the safety of all citizens,” he said. In recent months, the northwestern and north-central regions of Nigeria have recorded an uptick in attacks by armed gangs on communities in these regions. Hundreds have been killed and injured in the attacks. Bandit groups are known for mass killings and kidnappings for ransom in the country’s conflict-battered north. Most of the groups are made up of former herders in conflict with settled communities. Dozens of armed groups take advantage of the limited security presence in Nigeria’s mineral-rich northwestern region, carrying out attacks on villages and along major roads. Kidnappings for ransom have become a lucrative way for bandit groups to fund other crimes and control villages. Aside from the conflict in the country’s north-central and northwest, Nigeria is battling to contain an insurgency in the northeast where some 35,000 civilians have been killed and more than 2 million displaced, according to the U.N.

(Kim Hong-Ji/Pool Photo via AP) SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Four months after his release, South Korea’s disgraced former President Yoon Suk Yeol was sent back to a detention center after a Seoul court issued a warrant for his arrest Thursday. Yoon’s brief, ill-fated imposition of martial law on Dec. 3 led to his indictment on charges that he directed a rebellion, which is punishable by life imprisonment or death. Prompted by concerns he might destroy evidence, Yoon’s arrest could mark the start of a prolonged period in custody as investigators pursue additional charges. Yoon defended his martial law decree as a necessary step to quash “anti-state” liberal opponents, accusing them of abusing their legislative majority to obstruct his agenda. But the order lasted only hours, until a quorum of lawmakers broke through a blockade of heavily armed soldiers at the National Assembly and voted to overturn the order. Here is what Yoon faces in one of the most explosive criminal cases in South Korea’s history. ◆ Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. Yoon’s self-inflicted downfall extended a decadeslong run of South Korean presidencies ending badly. But the outspoken conservative, who was removed from office in April, is the first South Korean president to be arrested, released and then arrested again within months. Yoon became the country’s first sitting president to be detained following a Jan. 15 raid on his official residence in Seoul by hundreds of anti-corruption investigators and police, which came 12 days after presidential security forces blocked an attempt to take him into custody. Seoul Western District Court later granted a formal arrest warrant, citing concerns by investigators that he could destroy evidence. The decision triggered a riot by his supporters. Anti-corruption investigators then transferred the case to public prosecutors, who indicted him Jan. 26 on rebellion charges in the Seoul Central District Court, describing Yoon’s hourslong power grab as an illegal attempt to seize the legislature and election offices and arrest political opponents. Following a challenge from Yoon’s defense team, the court ordered his release on March 7, citing unresolved questions about whether anti-corruption investigators had proper authority to detain him. This allowed Yoon to stand trial for rebellion without being held in custody. He also attended his impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court, which formally removed him from office in April. There were moments when Yoon appeared to use his freedom to display defiance, such as when he showed up at a theater in May to watch a documentary film justifying his martial law decree, weeks ahead of the snap election to choose his successor. Another attempt to arrest Yoon became predictable after the country’s new president, Lee Jae Myung, a liberal who won the June 3 vote, quickly approved legislation to launch special investigations into Yoon’s martial law debacle and other criminal allegations involving his wife and administration. Yoon’s criminal case is now being handled by a team of investigators led by special prosecutor Cho Eun-suk, whose team questioned Yoon twice before submitting a request for his arrest warrant over the weekend. In their arrest warrant request, Cho’s team cited additional charges they are pushing against Yoon including obstructing official duties, abuse of power and falsifying and destroying documents. Those charges stem from accusations that he sidestepped legally mandated actions before attempting to enact martial law, such as deliberation by a properly convened Cabinet meeting, and fabricated documents including a martial law proclamation in a belated attempt to satisfy formal requirements. Yoon also is suspected of ordering presidential security officials to delete server records tied to “secret phones,” which refer to devices equipped with anti-wiretapping software he allegedly used to communicate with military commanders involved in carrying out the martial law order. He also faces accusations of unlawfully deploying presidential security forces like a private army to block an initial attempt by law enforcement to detain him at his residence in early January. Yoon’s lawyers have denied all the accusations and accused the special prosecutor of conducting a rushed, unsubstantiated investigation driven by political motives. No longer afforded the security privileges of a sitting president, Yoon will give up his personal belongings, receive a serial number, undergo a health checkup, change into light-green prison clothes and be confined to a small solitary cell reportedly equipped with a television, toilet, sink, table and mattress. He will be required to wake up and go to bed at designated times, eat in his cell and wash his own dishes, according to the detention center, which did not provide further details, citing security rules. He may have to get used to it. His new arrest could mark the beginning of an extended period in custody, potentially lasting months or longer. Yoon can initially be held at the detention center for up to 20 days while the special prosecutor aims to indict him on additional charges. If Yoon is indicted on new charges, he could be held for up to six months until an initial court ruling. If the court convicts him and hands down a prison term, Yoon would serve his sentence even as the case potentially moves to higher courts, said Park SungBae, a lawyer specializing in criminal law. Investigators also could extend Yoon’s detention by pursuing further charges, possibly including allegations that he deliberately sought to inflame tensions with rival North Korea to create a pretext for his authoritarian push. “It’s possible that the verdict in the rebellion trial could take more than six months, given the large number of defendants involved ... but there’s a strong likelihood that Yoon will receive prison sentences on the other indictments before then,” said Park, who views the charges related to blocking the initial arrest attempt as particularly damaging. Yoon’s lawyers could ask the court to review the legality of his arrest or seek his release on bail. But it’s unclear whether such efforts would succeed, given the severity of the charges and the court’s view that Yoon poses a threat to destroy evidence, Park said.

(Rick Barbero/The Register-Herald via AP, File) CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — Two former West Virginia correctional officers were sentenced to decades in prison on Wednesday for their roles in an assault that resulted in the death of an inmate. Mark Holdren, 41, was sentenced to 20 years in prison and Johnathan Walters, 33, was sentenced to 21 years in prison for the March 2022 attack in the Southern Regional Jail, according to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice. Quantez Burks, 37, was a pretrial detainee who died less than a day after he was booked into the jail in Beaver on a wanton endangerment charge, according to court documents. When Burks tried to push past an officer to leave his housing unit, he was taken to an interview room where he was handcuffed and restrained while officers including Holdren and Walters assaulted him. Burks was struck in the head multiple times, kicked and pepper-sprayed, according to the Justice Department. After the assault, Burks became unresponsive, so officers including Walters carried him to a different pod. Walters swung Burks’ head into a metal door to open it and the officers dropped his body onto a concrete cell floor. He was pronounced deceased a short time later by emergency medical personnel. Along with their guilty pleas, Holdren and Walters admitted that the interview room where they took Burks had no surveillance cameras. They also knew that officers used this room and other “blind spots” in the jail to assault inmates accused of misconduct. Holdren and Walters are two of six correctional officers who were indicted in this case. They include ex-jail supervisor Chad Lester who was sentenced in May to more than 17 years in federal prison for helping cover up the assault. Prior to the indictment of the six defendants, two other former correctional officers pleaded guilty to conspiring to use unreasonable force against Burks. The state medical examiner’s office attributed Burks’ primary cause of death to natural causes, prompting his family to seek a private autopsy. The family’s attorney revealed at a news conference in late 2022 that the second autopsy found Burks had multiple areas of blunt force trauma on his body. The case drew scrutiny to conditions and deaths at the jail, and in November 2023, West Virginia agreed to pay $4 million to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by inmates there. In recommending a default judgment in the lawsuit, a federal magistrate judge cited the intentional destruction of records in the case. That led to the firing of former Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation Executive Officer Brad Douglas and Homeland Security Chief Counsel Phil Sword. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Suarez pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit bank and mail fraud, along with aggravated identity theft. He faces several years in prison, including mandatory-minimum punishment of two years for the ID theft conviction, at his sentencing hearing in September before U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams.Suarez was indicted in 2023 but was living in Panama City, Panama, at the time. In early 2025, he was arrested in Panama and brought to South Florida to face the charges. According to a factual statement filed with his plea agreement, here’s how Suarez carried out the scam during an FBI-led undercover operation:More than 80 fraudulent checksIn March 2022, Suarez told a confidential informant that he had access to the bank account of an elderly person, who was 82 years old at the time. Suarez created and mailed dozens of falsified checks from Panama to South Florida to the victim’s bank with directions to cash them and return half of the money to his account at Bank of America. The ill-gotten proceeds were wired to his Miami-based company, Online Electronics.To carry out the scheme, Suarez’s fraudulent checks contained forged signatures designed to resemble that of the victim’s on a signature card at Truist Bank.“In total, Suarez and his co-conspirators stole $803,146 from [the victim’s] bank account at Truist through the issuance of more than 80 fraudulent checks to numerous different payees, including at least five individuals and various companies,” according to the factual statement signed by the defendant, his lawyer and a prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami.The statement also said the elderly person reviewed the names of the individuals and companies involved in the fraudulent check transactions. The person did not authorize any of them.The case, investigated by the FBI, Secret Service and FDIC’s Office of Inspector General, was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Thor Pogozelski.This story was originally published July 10, 2025 at 11:32 AM.

GoFundMe Andres Roberto Fiallos Estupiñan, accused of running down and killing a father who was jogging in his Shenandoah neighborhood, was booked into jail Tuesday after he was released from Jackson Memorial Hospital, where police had to Taser him to subdue him, his attorney said.Fiallos Estupiñan had been hospitalized since June 10 after suffering a broken ankle while fleeing the scene of the fatal hit-and-run at Southwest 21st Avenue and 18th Street. Residents tackled him near Shenandoah Park after they say he struck 50-year-old jogger Andrew Loretta with a Volkswagen Jetta, then careened into an ice cream truck and several other vehicles before attempting to run away.Jail records show that Fiallos Estupiñan, 36, was hit with multiple charges, including leaving the scene of the crash involving death, leaving the scene of a crash with serious bodily injury, reckless driving and vehicular homicide. READ MORE: Suspect in Miami hit-and-run unconscious for weeks after hospital clash with copsPsychotic episode caused the tragedy, attorney saysFiallos Estupiñan was hospitalized for weeks and listed in critical condition, leaving his family and attorney reeling with questions on how his condition deteriorated when he went in for a broken ankle. His attorney, Bradley Horenstein, said Fiallos Estupiñan — who has a history of mental health issues — had a psychotic episode that started before the crash.“This unimaginably tragic case is the result of Mr. Fiallos Estupiñan having suffered a psychotic break, which the hospital spent weeks successfully treating with medication,” Horenstein told the Miami Herald Wednesday.According to Horenstein, Fiallos Estupiñan became agitated while handcuffed to a hospital bed and attempted to get up and leave. A Miami police officer stationed at his bedside Tasered Fiallos Estupiñan multiple times to subdue him. When that had little effect, hospital staff gave him ketamine, an anesthetic used for surgery, and Estupinan was intubated for his safety. A psychiatric evaluation conducted at the hospital provided further detail on the severity of Fiallos Estupiñan’s condition. According to the five-page report, he ripped out his IV line, jumped out of bed naked while handcuffed and set off a hospital alarm after throwing himself against a wall vent.Horenstein said doctors continued to sedate him as he was not responding to medications for the psychosis. Further, Fiallos Estupiñan developed pneumonia and a bacterial infection in his lungs, which landed him in critical condition and the Intensive Care Unit. Andres Roberto Fiallo Estupinan, accused of the hit-and-run death of a Shenandoah father out for a jog on June 10, was jailed Tuesday, July 8, 2025. He’s facing a slew of charges. Estupinan family photo For three weeks, Horenstein was unable to speak to his client due to the heavy sedation.At one point, doctors performed a tracheotomy to avoid long-term damage to his vocal cords from prolonged intubation. Horenstein noted the situation was so dire that his client’s mother was granted a humanitarian visa to fly to the U.S. and sit by his bedside.“The hospital and the City of Miami Police Department were very accommodating,” Horenstein said.Fiallos Estupiñan was slowly weaned off the sedatives as the anti-psychotic medication began to take effect; he is now lucid and calm, Horenstein said.Set to be released on conditionsFiallos Estupiñan appeared in Miami-Dade Bond Court on Wednesday before Judge Gisela Cardonne Ely in an orange jumpsuit with a visible cast on his leg. At the hearing, prosecutors said Fiallos Estupiñan was driving 75 miles per hour in a 25-mph residential zone at the time of the crash. They argued he is both a danger to the community and a flight risk.Prosecutors requested Fiallos Estupiñan’s total bond be set at no less than $100,000 and that if released, he be placed on house arrest, be barred from driving and have his passport confiscated.Horenstein pushed back, telling the judge his client is not a danger to himself or others, but made no arguments on the $100,000 bond. He noted that Fiallos Estupiñan had been hospitalized for nearly a month after the crash and is a commercial engineer by profession. His mother and sister were present in the courtroom.The judge set bond at $25,000 for each charge, for a total of $100,000. She also ordered Fiallos Estupiñan to be placed on Level 2 house arrest, meaning he can only leave home for work, church or meetings with his lawyer.Fiallos Estupiñan, who was born in Ecuador and lived in Chile, was also ordered to surrender his passport before being released from jail. Horenstein said the passport was believed to be inside Estupinan’s car, which has been impounded as evidence by the Miami Police Department.Despite that, Judge Cardonne Ely said the passport must be turned over before Estupinan could walk out of jail. Prosecutors asked Horenstein to provide proof the passport was not in his client’s possession. The judge removed the passport confiscation condition after Horenstein said he confirmed with the Miami Police sergeant supervising the case that the passport was in their possession.Witnesses held him downAccording to his arrest affidavit, Fiallos Estupiñan was driving a gray 2012 Volkswagen Passat on June 10 at a “high rate of speed” southbound on Southwest 21st Avenue near 17th Street just before 7 p.m. Police say he had an expired Florida driver’s license.At the same time, Andrew Loretta, 50, was jogging along the west side of 21st Avenue, heading toward 18th Street.Surveillance footage shows Fiallos Estupiñan striking the jogger from behind with such force that Loretta was thrown into the air and both of his legs were severed.After hitting Loretta, Fiallos Estupiñan crashed into a white 2013 Nissan ice cream van that was stopped at 21st Avenue and 18th Street, serving children at Shenandoah Park. Police say Estupinan made no “visible attempt to brake” before the impact.The Volkswagen then struck two more parked vehicles: a gray 2019 Toyota and a white 2023 Mercedes SUV, both on the west side of 21st Avenue near the park.Two witnesses told police that Fiallos Estupiñan immediately got out of the car and ran away without trying to help the injured jogger or calling 911. He ran into Shenandoah Park, where several bystanders stopped him and held him down until officers arrived.Loretta was pronounced dead at the scene. Estupinan had a broken ankle, while a passenger in one of the hit cars had a skull fracture.A beloved community memberIn Miami’s Shenandoah neighborhood, just off Coral Way, the sudden death of Loretta—a married telecommunications executive and father of two teenagers—has left his family heartbroken and the community in shock. Friends and relatives described him as an avid jogger and soccer enthusiast who moved to Miami from California in 2000. He was fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.A GoFundMe page to support Andrew’s family has raised over $193,000 with just over 900 donations.“I hope that justice is served. Not only for Andy, but for the family ... At the end of the day [Andres] has to deal with his own karma. I honestly feel a lot of compassion for him. It’s just a terrible situation,” John Loretta, Andrew’s cousin, who lives in Kendall, said.The Loretta family, including his wife and children, said in a statement through their attorney that they are grateful for the support they have received.“This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the Loretta family, and they remain deeply grateful for the outpouring of support from family, friends, and the community,” Raul Chacon, the family’s attorney, said in a statement to the Miami Herald. “At this point, they will have no further comment on the ongoing legal proceedings. Thank you for respecting their privacy and understanding their need to grieve in peace. “Miami Herald writer Isabel Rivera contributed to this report.This story was originally published July 9, 2025 at 4:17 PM.

Miami Police are not saying what they’re doing to bring him back. Jason Getz Jason Getz-USA TODAY Sports A month after being charged with attempted murder, former NFL star Antonio Brown has posted videos on social media flaunting his lavish lifestyle abroad — riding around in expensive cars and sauntering on a yacht overlooking Dubai’s skyscrapers.It’s almost as if Brown, 37, were taunting police. But Miami Police will not say whether they consider Brown on the run — or if they’re working to bring him back to the U.S. to face trial.A Miami-Dade judge signed off on Brown’s arrest warrant a month ago. But police don’t appear to be looking for him and refuse to discuss the case. There’s also no record or court date for Brown in the database of Miami-Dade circuit court records.READ MORE: Antonio Brown charged with attempted murder after shooting at Miami boxing eventIn a video uploaded to X on Thursday, Brown is seen celebrating his birthday in a red Ferrari 812 GTS and hanging out with his young sons on the water.

Brown had an attorney early on who secured him a $10,000 bond, including house arrest. As of Thursday, it’s unclear if Brown was being represented by an attorney. Another unknown: whether prosecutors will continue to honor the bond agreement in place. Brown could be detained by the FBI or U.S. Marshals if Miami Police or the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office request that the federal agencies issue a warrant for Brown’s return, said Jeffrey Sloman, a Miami criminal defense attorney who served briefly as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. This is usually accomplished through a federal charge brought forward if a person is avoiding prosecution. If a person remains a fugitive, they may not be granted bond to get out of jail, or a judge could be more harsh in their confinement, Sloman said. The attorney said to look no further than his client Ohad Fisherman, who was on his honeymoon in Japan but returned quickly to address the criminal charge against him. Fisherman — who was entangled in one of the cases brought by the state against the Alexander brothers — had a sex crime charge against him dropped on Monday by state prosecutors.READ MORE: Alexander brothers’ friend cleared in sex case — tearful, angry at state prosecutors“It’s in [Brown’s] best interest to come back immediately, so hopefully the judge would give him a reasonable bond so he can fight the charges out of jail,” Sloman said. “It’s very difficult to fight a case in jail. If Mr. Brown continues to avoid prosecution, eventually he will travel somewhere or to some place and he will be arrested.”Padilla told the Herald police likely believe that Brown will return to South Florida because he has property and children in the area. Formally extraditing Brown, he said, would be costly.

Daniel A. Varela dvarela@miamiherald.com “It’s not easy for the FBI to be dragging people from the Middle East,” Padilla said. “There’ll be a point that if this continues, it could manifest into something larger.”Brown should contact an attorney to turn himself in, Padilla said, because a judge could factor in the amount of time he was abroad after the warrant was signed when deciding his bond. “This is a serious crime. This isn’t going to go away,” Padilla said. “...He’s going to have to face these charges.” Grethel Aguila Miami Herald Go to X Email this person Grethel covers courts and the criminal justice system for the Miami Herald.

Once limited to Southeast Asia, the criminal model is spreading — and uses AI.https://p.dw.com/p/4whWKOnline scam centers were initially concentrated in Cambodia, with additional trafficking hubs later uncovered in Laos and MyanmarImage: Kyodo News/IMAGOAdvertisementHuman trafficking-fueled scam centers have significantly expanded their operations worldwide, according to a crime trend update released on Monday by the international police agency Interpol. Hubs where trafficking victims are forced to take part in online fraud first emerged in a few Southeast Asian nations, but investigators are now also uncovering similar fraud centers in other regions. Where are scam centers spreading? According to the international police organization, victims now come from 66 countries across all continents, highlighting what Interpol describes as a global crisis involving hundreds of thousands of people. Scam centers are now increasingly found in other regions, including the Middle East, West Africa — fast emerging as a new regional hub — and Central America. Victims are often lured with fake job offers and then held captive in scam compounds. Many are blackmailed over alleged debts, beaten, sexually exploited, and in some cases tortured or raped. Inside these centers, they are forced to run online scams, mostly targeting people abroad to steal money.Freed captives describe scam operations in MyanmarTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video A 2024 Interpol-led operation exposed dozens of cases where victims were coerced into committing fraud, including a raid on an industrial-scale scam centre in the Philippines. That same year, police dismantled a centre in Namibia where 88 youths were forced to scam others. Emerging technologies are fuelling this trend further. The crime update notes a surge in the use of artificial intelligence, from generating fake job ads to creating deepfake profiles for sextortion and romance scams. Who are the victims? Interpol says the pool of those preyed upon has widened significantly. While early human trafficking victims were mainly Chinese-speaking and came from China, Malaysia, Thailand or Singapore, people are now being trafficked to such hubs from South America, East Africa and Western Europe. Tackling this rapidly globalizing threat requires a coordinated international response, said said Interpol's acting head of police services Cyril Gout. Who are the people traffickers? The report found that about 90% of human trafficking facilitators came from Asia, while 11% were from South America or Africa. About 80% of these facilitators were men, with 61% aged between 20 and 39. Online scam centers were initially concentrated in Cambodia, with additional trafficking hubs later uncovered in Laos and Myanmar. Today, similar operations have been identified in at least four more Asian countries, and evidence shows the model is spreading to other regions such as West Africa, where cyber-enabled financial crime is already common. In its findings, Interpol warned that the spread of such criminal networks needs urgent, coordinated action to disrupt trafficking routes and support victims. Interpol said that these criminal hubs are increasingly intertwined with other major transnational crimes, demanding a globally coordinated response. Trafficking routes used for scam centers are being exploited for smuggling drugs, firearms, and endangered wildlife like tigers and pangolins, Interpol said.

Here's how the death cap became the center of a chilling murder case. https://p.dw.com/p/4x8P8Even small amounts of death cap mushrooms are lethal if consumed.Image: Hans Reinhard/Okapia/picture-allianceAdvertisementA jury in Australia has found Erin Patterson guilty on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder. The murder weapon: Toxic mushrooms. Prosecutors argued Patterson intentionally served four of her family members with meal portions containing toxic death cap mushrooms in 2023. Patterson denied being guilty, originally telling police she had used store-bought mushrooms from a supermarket, then an Asian grocer in Melbourne. A search of such stores found no evidence that poisonous mushrooms had ever been sold. During the trial, Patterson said she may have foraged for the mushrooms but could not say for certain where she had obtained the death caps. Why are death cap mushrooms so deadly? Deadly by name and by nature, death cap mushrooms (Amanita phalloides) are full of a highly stable toxin called alpha-Amanitin. The toxin is so stable that it won't break down when exposed to heat in cooking. When a death cap is eaten, people don’t usually feel symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea until at least 6 hours later. During this time the alpha-Amanitin toxins are making their way through the bloodstream into organs of the body. The toxin primarily acts in the liver, where it causes cells in the liver to die. Alpha-Amanitin binds with RNA polymerase-II enzymes, preventing the cells from creating new proteins. Eventually, the liver starts to shut down. Death can occur within 24 hours. Careful identification required The Amanita genus of fungi is well-known for their toxic properties. This group include the fairytale toadstool commonly known as the fly agaric, death caps, and destroying angels . But some other Amanita mushrooms are edible. Most cases of death cap poisoning are often a case of misidentification — their classic white appearance and domed cap looks like many other types of fungi. Identification of mushrooms requires a knowledge of different parts of the anatomy: the cap or fruiting body, the gills or spores beneath the cap, and the stipe — or stalk. While death caps look like many other mushrooms, one defining characteristic is their bad smell. They don't store well at all, unless you dehydrate them. They quickly go very stinky and very nasty, Brett Summerell, a fungi expert and Chief Scientist at the Botanic Gardens of Sydney, Australia, told DW. Because of the risk of misidentification by amateurs, it's usually recommended that foragers go for edible species that cannot be mistaken. Of course, foraging under the supervision of a trained mycologist — a fungi scientist — is usually a safe option. The famous red and white toadstool is a member of the Amanita genus, and a cousin of other deadly mushroom species.Image: FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP No death caps in the supermarket The jury ultimately didn’t find Patterson’s defense — that she mixed up foraged mushrooms in the same container as store-bought ones — believable. The prosecution argued Patterson knowingly put the toxic mushrooms in the home-cooked lunch and disposed of evidence. Summerell said the likelihood that death caps could get into store-bought products is, to be honest, farcical. The reason? Death caps only grow next to oak and beech trees. Death caps, like many fungi, are mycorrhizal, meaning they have a symbiotic relationship with the tree species. Death caps obtain their nutrients from nearby tree roots and return nutrients to the nearby soil. But because they can only grow at the base of oak and beech trees, it means there's no chance of them sprouting in a commercial setting, where spores are cultivated in highly controlled conditions — and with no trees in sight. Australia could get rid of death caps Death caps aren’t native to Australia, and neither are the oak and beech trees that support them. The trees were first introduced into Australia from Europe in the 19th ecntury, and death caps in the 1960s. Summerell and other mycologists are now discussing the possibility of removing oak trees in some parts of Australia. We have argued that, in Sydney, if it's at all possible, we should start to think about removing oak trees from some of these suburbs just from the point of view of a public health risk, said Summerell. Removing introduced oaks could harbor positive benefits, both from a public health perspective by removing the risk of the top cause of mushroom poisoning, as well as providing more space for native Australian plant life.

Here's how the death cap became the center of a chilling murder case. https://p.dw.com/p/4x8P8Even small amounts of death cap mushrooms are lethal if consumed.Image: Hans Reinhard/Okapia/picture-allianceAdvertisementA jury in Australia has found Erin Patterson guilty on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder. The murder weapon: Toxic mushrooms. Prosecutors argued Patterson intentionally served four of her family members with meal portions containing toxic death cap mushrooms in 2023. Patterson denied being guilty, originally telling police she had used store-bought mushrooms from a supermarket, then an Asian grocer in Melbourne. A search of such stores found no evidence that poisonous mushrooms had ever been sold. During the trial, Patterson said she may have foraged for the mushrooms but could not say for certain where she had obtained the death caps. Why are death cap mushrooms so deadly? Deadly by name and by nature, death cap mushrooms (Amanita phalloides) are full of a highly stable toxin called alpha-Amanitin. The toxin is so stable that it won't break down when exposed to heat in cooking. When a death cap is eaten, people don’t usually feel symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea until at least 6 hours later. During this time the alpha-Amanitin toxins are making their way through the bloodstream into organs of the body. The toxin primarily acts in the liver, where it causes cells in the liver to die. Alpha-Amanitin binds with RNA polymerase-II enzymes, preventing the cells from creating new proteins. Eventually, the liver starts to shut down. Death can occur within 24 hours.

But some criminologists doubt the figures.https://p.dw.com/p/4wuVjShoplifting is on the rise, say retailersImage: Carsten Milbret/imageBROKER/picture allianceAdvertisementGermany has never had more shoplifters than in 2024. An annual survey of 98 retailers estimates a 3% increase on the year before — amounting to some €4.95 billion ($5.84 billion) in losses. The latest study by Germany's Retail Institute (EHI) on inventory differences shows that the vast majority of those losses (€4.2 billion) was down to theft from customers, employees, or delivery workers, the EHI said, which would mean losses of some €570 million to the public purse through lost sales tax. The EHI also said that retailers had to resort to balancing out their losses and the costs of extra security by increasing prices. Study author Frank Horst calculated that some 1.5% of prices in stores could now be attributed to covering theft and security. Shoplifting techniques The EHI said there had also been a 5% increase in organized shoplifting, which accounted for a third of the total shoplifting losses. Horst said this could be individual thieves working their way through a shopping list, or else, the thefts could be carried out by coordinated groups. One of them drives a vehicle, one of them distracts the staff, or shields the one putting the goods away so they can't be seen, Horst told DW. Sometimes so-called depots are set up in the store, where all the goods are packed in a bag, and then someone else carries it out in a surreptitious moment. The survey does not include exact breakdowns of the kinds of articles that get stolen, but Horst says that thieves often target anything small, expensive, and that can be easily re-sold, such as perfume and cosmetics. There had also been a rise in the theft of foods, especially relatively expensive things like meats and cheeses. But Nicole Bögelein, a criminologist at Cologne University, cast doubt on how useful the study actually is. She told DW that the researchers estimate that 98% of cases aren't even discovered. So it's just an assumption that the majority of these losses can be attributed to theft, she said. Bögelein also cast doubt on the EHI's conclusion that there are more organized shoplifting gangs, as that could simply be because store detectives are more on the lookout for such groups. 'Poverty crimes' Despite its shortcomings, the annual EHI survey is one of the few shoplifting studies there are, and it is focused mostly on the economic impact. Bögelein, by training a sociologist as well as a criminologist, has a different perspective and says that almost all cases of shoplifting are so-called poverty crimes — defined as crimes that don't cost any money to carry out, and are committed by people because they have no money. Bögelein's own investigations into shoplifting have found that the people who are caught are often poor — possibly, she says, also because store detectives are more likely to keep an eye on people who look poor. Official statistics suggest that the majority of thefts from shops are relatively petty. According to German federal police statistics, in 66.7% of discovered and prosecuted thefts, the value of the items stolen was under €50 and in 40.2% of cases even under €15. The punishment is usually a small fine, or, if the fine can't or won't be paid, a prison sentence. Germany a 'paradise' for shoplifters? Horst described Germany as a paradise for shoplifters, as the punishments are often relatively mild. Though theoretically thieves can be imprisoned for up to five years, he said that in practice first-time offenders are often not charged at all. Bögelein said that deterrence might have an effect on some minor thefts, but was generally skeptical of the idea that more punishment discourages petty crime. People don't not steal because they're scared of punishment, she argued. In criminology, we find that people stick to rules because they think those rules are correct and because they fear a bad conscience if they don't stick to them. Public transport operators in Germany often charge people a fee for riding without a ticket, but may also press charges, especially for repeat offenders.Image: picture-alliance/dpa/J. Wolf Should shoplifting be decriminalized in Germany? There has been a debate among German criminologists about to what extent poverty crimes should be decriminalized altogether, on the grounds that such crimes are usually victimless and therefore don't require criminal justice. There have long been calls to downgrade one classic poverty crime — riding public transport without a ticket — to a misdemeanor, partly because punishing it has become a burden to public coffers and is clogging up the justice system. Between 8,000 and 9,000 people end up in prison in Germany every year for riding without a ticket. But Horst argued that shoplifting shouldn't always be defined as a poverty crime: The EHI estimates that two-thirds of shoplifting cases were what he called opportunistic perpetrators, and many of them are not necessarily poor. Horst does think that inflation and higher prices for basic items may be playing a role in the rise of shoplifting, but he was reluctant to accept that poverty was the driving element of all theft. It could be a protest theft, because people are saying they're not prepared to accept the price rises for a particular product, he said, I'm sure poverty is a part of it, but that it explains the rise on its own — I don't see that.

But according to media reports, they were quickly attacked by hundreds of men on motorbikes armed with makeshift weapons, known in Kenya as goons. Nairobi: Police, protesters clash in second week of unrestTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Police vehicles and officers appeared as vendors hastily packed up their stalls. One of the officers pointed his gun in the direction of protesters, then ran with a colleague to a vendor named Jonah Kariuki. The officers pushed the man. As he is shoved and is moving away, Kariuki glances back. The officer raises his weapon and shoots 22-year-old Kariuki at close range in the head — who crumples to the sidewalk. After the shooting, the officer and his colleague walk away. Police's reaction to the shooting Police did not directly deny any cooperation with the armed goons, releasing a statement saying it does not condone such unlawful groupings. Police also said the officer who shot Kariuki in the head using an anti-riot shotgun had been arrested. Activists called for the officer to be charged. The judiciary in a statement on Wednesday said it was committed to uphold justice in all cases, including those involving alleged police brutality. Nairobi: Pro-government counter-protesters clash with a protester during a protest over the death of Kenyan blogger Albert Ojwang in police custodyImage: Thomas Mukoya/REUTERS A wave of protests Tensions were already high in the East African country as it marks a year since massive Gen Z-led protests over the economy. Kenyan government's latest finance bill avoided the tax hikes that sparked weeks of protests in mid-2024. Rights groups say over 60 people were killed and dozens more were illegally detained by security forces in the aftermath. The protests peaked when thousands stormed parliament on June 25, 2024 when lawmakers debated the unpopular finance bill. The bill is now expected to take effect on July 1, 2025. But demonstrations picked up again over the death of 31-year-old teacher and blogger Albert Ojwang, who died in police custody earlier this month. Protesters want a senior officer they blame for the death to resign.

Why is there a market for her content in the Balkan country and how are some Bulgarians fighting it?https://p.dw.com/p/4vrvKOn her social media profiles, Bulgarian influencer Zornitsa Gyutsova posts misogynistic advice about how men should 'deal with' womenImage: Zgyutsova/TikTokAdvertisement Women love men who can be violent if need be. That's why they like men who hit them, Bulgarian influencer Zornitsa Gyutsova tells her followers. Gyutsova suggests that not only do women prefer men who physically assault them, but that this is also the way men should behave because a woman should respect a man's physical power since she is unable to comprehend his intellectual power. This is the kind of advice that can be found on Gyutsova's social media profiles and in a private group founded by her on Telegram called Upstanding Man. 'Equality is contrary to human nature' Zornitsa Gyutsova offers her followers private chats over video where she teaches them how to deal with women — for a fee, of course. Many influencers, life coaches and other online personalities in Bulgaria and elsewhere offer private sessions or courses. What makes Gyutsova's content stand out from the rest is that its sole purpose is to explain to men that they need to learn to control their partners both psychologically and, if necessary, physically.There have been numerous protests against violence against women in Bulgaria in recent years, such as this one in 2023Image: Alexandar Detev/DW In Gyutsova's view, men in general have been treated badly by women, and women are the ones who exert violence on men, namely by not paying them enough respect. The idea of equality is like a worm in people's brains that insists men and women should be partners […] which is so contrary to human nature that it can never work, Gyutsova declared in a long video about her work that was broadcast on Bulgarian National Television. Although the broadcaster, which is partly financed by taxpayer's money, has since removed the video from its platforms, it has never publicly commented on the case. Huge backlash Gyutsova's profiles on social media have been gaining traction for several years now. Screenshots and videos from her private Telegram group chat recently surfaced on social media, triggering a huge backlash in Bulgaria. Local woman Petya Krasteva was so appalled by Gyutsova's online content that she filed a complaint against Gyutsova with the prosecutor's office. On her social media channels, she not only encourages people to degrade women and use violence against them, she also boasts that she uses the same methods on her child and her cat, she told DW. I thought to myself: This is not only absolutely unacceptable, it's criminal. Gender discrimination not a crime in Bulgaria Many other women did the same as Krasteva, only to find out a couple of weeks later that their efforts had been in vain.Petya Krasteva was appalled by Zornitsa Gyutsova's online content and filed a complaint against her with the prosecutor's officeImage: Nikola Gyulmezov In an official reply, the prosecutor's office stated that nothing could be done because Bulgaria's criminal code does not define gender discrimination as a crime and that the issue was a matter for the Commission against Discrimination. Krasteva promptly lodged a complaint with this commission, but received another negative answer based on the same reasoning. Profiles briefly taken down Although these complaints did not lead to charges being brought against Gyutsova, the backlash did have an impact. The outcry and the fact that Gyutsova's social media accounts were reported by people who found their content abhorrent, meant that the influencer's TikTok and Instagram profiles were deactivated. They were, however, reactivated a short time later. Impunity for abusers Krasteva feels that part of the reason why content like Gyutsova's strikes a chord in Bulgaria is that while patriarchal norms and domestic violence are not accepted in the country, Bulgarian society often turns a blind eye to them. The other huge problem, she says, is that as with many other social issues, there is a complete lack of consequences for the perpetrators. Valentina Dimitrova, a psychologist who works for the Emprove Foundation, a Bulgarian organization that supports women who have suffered domestic violence, holds a similar view.Psychologist Valentina Dimitrova says that content like Gyutsova's is dangerous because 'it can truly cost a human life'Image: Venera Velkovska Sadly it's embedded in the Bulgarian mindset that we often just accept that things are bad and we do nothing about it, says Dimitrova. She believes that this is also why many women stay in violent relationships: They simply have no faith in the authorities because time and time again, men who beat or even kill their partners face no legal consequences. Although some people seem to think that social media content is less problematic than actual abuse in real life, Dimitrova stresses the dangers associated with such content: It can truly cost a human life. A global online problem Misogynistic online content that paints women as lesser human beings and men as oppressed by women is not unique to Bulgaria. Such content has been growing and spreading all over the world in recent years. Influencers like Andrew Tate, who faces charges of rape, bodily harm, human trafficking and more, have created a whole movement around this sort of content. Gyutsova fits neatly into this category of influencer, but what makes her different is that she is a woman. What role does feminism play? Dimitrova thinks one issue here is that feminism is often misunderstood. Feminism does not entail men being suppressed and women controlling them. It means that women can have equal rights and can function as equals to men not only in society but also in their personal relationships, she says. Dimitrova also believes that the patriarchal notion that men should not be allowed to express emotions is highly problematic. This is reflected in Gyutsova's content, which suggests that men are weak and not manly if they dare to express their fears, emotions or feelings.People in Sofia attend a protest against domestic violence and violence against women in Bulgaria in 2023 after a young woman was stabbed by her ex-partner Image: Alexandar Detev/DW It's a vicious circle: Men who are not allowed to express any sort of emotion for fear of being labeled weak don't know what to do when they experience something frustrating in their relationships and so they resort to aggression, says Dimitrova. What can be done? Dimitrova suggests that first and foremost, men should receive support and their concerns should not just be swept under the carpet. She stresses, however, that this support should not validate the inclination to deal with problems by exerting psychological or physical violence on women. Although the Emprove Foundation focuses primarily on women's rights and issues, it does have a project that focuses on men's mental health — something the foundation says is incredibly important in the fight against gender-based violence. Men should be encouraged to connect to a healthy understanding of themselves, so they can build healthy relationships as well, says Dimitrova. Petya Krasteva firmly believes that even though authorities in Bulgaria rarely provide the support needed in cases like this, society should not remain indifferent. We should be as loud as possible when something like this turns up, she says. We should be perfectly clear that it is unacceptable. That way, other people who come across this content will know that this is not something that society approves of, and that could help them realize that they shouldn't have anything to do with it. Dimitrova agrees. We will keep talking about it [this kind of content], calling it out and not tolerating it until the authorities wake up.

Why did an Argentinian court ordered an international warrant for her arrest?https://p.dw.com/p/4uJX3Aung San Suu Kyi has been imprisoned by the Myanmar military since 2021 (archive picture from 2012)Image: Loviny Christophe/ABACA/picture alliance AdvertisementIt is rare for an international arrest warrant to be issued against a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and political prisoner whose release is demanded by both the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council. However, this is precisely what occurred in February this year, when an Argentinian court asked for the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi. The court's decision applies to 25 Myanmar citizens wanted on charges linked to genocide and crimes against humanity. The list includes not only Myanmar's military leader Min Aung Hlaing, but also former State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and former President Htin Kyaw. Suu Kyi effectively served as Myanmar's top civilian leader before the military staged a coup in February 2021. She has been imprisoned ever since. The court in Argentina claims it has the jurisdiction to order a warrant for Suu Kyi's arrest based on a legal principle that some serious crimes can be prosecuted regardless of where they were committed. The specific case focuses on discrimination against Myanmar's Rohingya ethnic minority. The Muslim Rohingya live predominantly in the western state of Rakhine, and their status as citizens and as an ethnic group recognized by the state of Myanmar has been disputed for decades. The Rohingya crisis of 2017 Since 1988, Myanmar has seen an ongoing political conflict between the military and military-backed parties on one side and Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, on the other. In 2016, after many years of stalemate, the military and Aung San Suu Kyi reached a truce. A kind of dual government was established, with Aung San Suu Kyi heading the civilian branch and Min Aung Hlaing heading the military, which had constitutionally secured independence and far-reaching political rights. On October 9, 2016, Rohingya insurgents attacked several border and police posts of the Myanmar security forces. In August 2017, the security forces launched so-called clearance operations. As a result, thousands of Rohingya were killed and around 700,000 fled to neighboring Bangladesh, with exact figures still unclear due to the nature of the ethnically-charged conflict. Rohingya refugees fear increased hardship due to aid cutsTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video While the military denied using excessive force, international watchdogs and the UN agree that Myanmar's actions against the Rohingya constitute grave human rights violations. Still, two questions remain: First, did the offensive amount to genocide? Second, how much of it was the responsibility of Aung San Suu Kyi? The question of genocide Concerns that a genocide was happening in Myanmar have already been voiced before 2017. In 2015, the human rights organization Fortify Rights published a report with the Allard K. Lovenstein International Human Rights Clinic from Yale Law School in which was stated that there is strong evidence that genocide is being committed against Rohingya. Those voices only grew louder after 2017, and in November 2019, Gambia initiated a case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Myanmar, claiming violations of the UN's Genocide Convention. The ICJ has yet to rule on the case, however, meaning that the existence of genocide remains unconfirmed in a legal sense. But for human rights organizations like Fortify Rights, the Burmese-Rohingya Organization UK (BROUK) and the former UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar, Tomas Ojea Quintana, there is no doubt that genocide did take place. Quintana, an Argentinian, told Radio Free Asia that the court in his native country understood what was at stake, which is the genocide against the Rohingya people. The question of responsibility Aung San Suu Kyi was a globally renowned human rights advocate since the early 1990s until the events of 2017. She was also heading Myanmar's civilian government during the deadly wave of violence against the Rohingya. As chief councilor, she was notably hesitant to speak out against the military and even went to The Hague in 2019 to defend Myanmar at the International Court of Justice. She denied genocide was happening in Rakhine but admitted human rights violations, which would be investigated by Myanmar. She later confirmed this position in an interview with the Financial Times. War crimes were committed during the internal armed conflict with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army by members of Myanmar's security forces and civilians, she told the paper. At the same time, Aung San Suu Kyi pointed to a report by the Independent Commission of Enquiry (ICOE) which was set up by Myanmar without Rohingya representatives. The ICOE found no evidence of genocide, she told the paper, despite its report recording killing of civilians, disproportionate use of force, looting of property, and destruction of abandoned homes of Muslims. For those who believe Myanmar troops committed genocide against the Rohingya, Aung San Suu Kyi's refusal to recognize it makes her complicit. But does her stance — admitting that human rights violations happened but not genocide — mean Aung San Suu Kyi is guilty of committing genocide? What do we know about the Argentinian court order? The reasons behind the Argentinian court's decision to seek an international arrest warrant are not fully clear, as neither the ruling nor the exact evidence on which the ruling was based are publicly available. DW contacted the Argentinian court and the Argentinian human rights commission to get more information in the matter, but received no reply. The 2021 coup triggered protests in Myanmar, which eventually escalated into a civil war.Image: Sai Aung Main/AFP In the months following the announcement, Myanmar expert and former ambassador Derek Tonkin published an academic paper on the issue, examining the sources which most likely led to the arrest warrant. He writes that the petition [on which the decision of the court seems to be based] contains much narrative and opinion which are debatable and questionable, and in some areas are simply wrong. Commenting on the claim that Aung San Suu Kyi and others validated the genocide against the Rohingya, Tonkin states, it is not true and is supported by no evidence anywhere in the petition. Tonkin also rejects the accusation that Aung San Suu Kyi was directly responsible for the events in Rakhine State during her time as state counsellor at the time. I find this totally unconvincing. The Tatmadaw [the Myanmar military] refused to accept Aung San Suu Kyi's appointment, he writes. So far, the arrest warrant hasn't had any impact. Aung San Suu Kyi seems set to celebrate her 80th birthday next month as a prisoner in Myanmar as the civil war rages on. With the passage of time, the international arrest warrant might end up as a mere footnote in a long political career filled with legal battles.

Sanjay Verma was shot dead on Monday at around 10 am, right outside his showroom in Abohar. According to eyewitnesses, three motorcycle-borne assailants lay in wait for him. The moment Verma stepped out of his car, they opened indiscriminate fire, killing him on the spot before fleeing the scene. While the shooters escaped and have yet to be identified, the Punjab Police announced the arrest of two of their accomplices, Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan, both residents of Patiala district, for helping the shooters escape in the car. However, within hours, both men were killed in a police encounter. This development has added fuel to the controversy. BJP General Secretary Manjinder Singh Sirsa accused the Punjab government of mishandling the law and order situation. On his visit to Chandigarh Wednesday, Sirsa said, “First of all, the Punjab government is not able to control the law and order and criminals… Punjab has become a police state. If Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has a clean image, he should get a CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) inquiry conducted into these encounters so the truth comes out.” Reacting sharply, AAP’s Punjab state president Aman Arora called the BJP’s stance “extremely shameful,” accusing it of siding with gangsters instead of supporting Verma’s bereaved family. Arora said, “While the entire Punjab stands with the family of Shri Sanjay Verma, Manjinder Singh Sirsa’s open support for gangsters today proves that the BJP is backing criminals even through central jails.” After meeting the family of Sanjay Verma on Monday, Arora had stated that gangsters lodged in jails outside Punjab were behind such heinous criminal activities. Whereas, Union Minister of State Ravneet Singh Bittu held the Mann government responsible for the ‘growing fear and lawlessness’ across Punjab. “Instead of owning up to their failure, AAP leaders are shamelessly pointing fingers at the Centre. This is not governance –it’s a complete abdication of duty,” he added. Bittu called Arora’s remarks “irresponsible” and “highly condemnable,” accusing him of trying to deflect attention from the AAP government’s failure to maintain law and order in the state. In a statement released on Monday, Bittu announced that he would write to the Governor of Punjab, urging him to take cognisance of Arora’s “baseless allegations”. He also sought written clarifications from Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav and Chief Secretary KAP Sinha, questioning whether Arora’s statement reflected the official position of the Bhagwant Mann-led government. “Aman Arora’s claim that gangster Lawrence Bishnoi is safe in Gujarat under the Centre’s protection is nothing but an excuse to hide the AAP government’s incompetence. These kinds of inflammatory and misleading remarks are both dangerous and unacceptable,” said Bittu. He reaffirmed that the central government has always taken a tough stance against terrorism and organised crime. “We conducted surgical strikes inside Pakistan when needed. Do you think gangsters are beyond our reach? Once the BJP forms government in Punjab, we’ll show what decisive action really looks like,” Bittu said. Pointing to the killing of Sanjay Verma, Bittu accused the Punjab government of completely surrendering to the gangster nexus. “Extortion threats and targeted killings have become the new normal for Punjab’s business community,” he said. Adding to the political slugfest, AAP’s Abohar constituency in-charge Arun Narang displayed a photo showing Abohar MLA Sandeep Jakhar with Shakti, a bike driver allegedly linked to the murder. Sandeep Jakhar, who is a suspended Congress MLA and nephew of Punjab BJP chief Sunil Jakhar, clarified that the picture was from the 2022 assembly election campaign. “Many people get pictures taken with us during campaigns. It’s illogical to link that picture to this crime,” he said. ‘We have full trust’ Jagat Verma, elder brother of Sanjay Verma, has expressed satisfaction over the police probe. In a video, Jagat Verma said, “We have full trust in the Punjab Police and we are satisfied with the ongoing police investigation. We humbly appeal to one and all to please stop doing politics over this issue. We appeal to the police to nab the rest of the culprits soon… We trust that we will get justice soon.” State of probe The police said their investigations have revealed that the getaway bike was driven by one Shakti, a daily wager from Azimgarh village of Abohar. While escaping, the attackers lost control of their bike and forcibly snatched another two-wheeler. They later abandoned it on Seeto Road and allegedly fled in a waiting Swift car, driven by Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan. Jaspreet Singh’s family has denied any involvement, alleging that he was picked up from his house in Mardankheri village of Patiala during the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday, and that they later received news of his death. They maintain that Jaspreet was a daily wager with no criminal background. The police said Jaspreet had a criminal background, and released a few pictures of him brandishing weapons. The details of his criminal record haven’t been revealed as of now. At the time of filing this report, the postmortem examination of Jaspreet and Ram was underway at the Abohar Civil Hospital under strict police cover. Meanwhile, gangster Aarzoo Bishnoi had claimed responsibility for the murder on social media, tagging Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar and Maharashtra’s Shivam Lonker hours after the murder.

The victim, identified as Sanjeev, 19, a resident of Rajiv Colony, Panchkula, had reportedly come to the area to meet a friend when he was attacked. According to police officials, Sanjeev was surrounded by three to four individuals around 10.30 pm. He was stabbed multiple times in the chest and abdomen with a knife, and then left critically injured on the roadside. The assailants fled the scene immediately after the attack. Soon after, a crowd gathered at the spot, and the PCR was informed. Sanjeev was rushed to the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, Chandigarh, where he succumbed to his injuries during treatment, the police said. The Chandigarh Police have apprehended two minors in connection with the crime. “An FIR has been registered, and the two juveniles have been booked for murder. They will be sent to a juvenile home,” said Vijay Singh, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Chandigarh Police. Sources revealed that the accused allegedly attacked Sanjeev because he was reportedly stalking their sister. The police have not ruled out the involvement of more individuals and are continuing their investigation. Meanwhile, the preliminary postmortem report has stated that the victim died due to punctured vital organs caused by the stabbings. The incident has triggered tension in the area, with residents demanding increased police patrolling and swift justice. Teenager injured in stabbing attack in Sector 40 A 19-year-old teenager was critically injured in a targeted stabbing attack by a group of around half a dozen minors in Block C of Sector 40 in Chandigarh on Sunday night. The assault is suspected to be a result of personal enmity. According to the police, the attackers arrived on three to four motorbikes and were not wearing helmets. They attacked the youth and fled the scene within seconds. The victim was initially rushed by his family members to a private hospital in Mohali, but was later shifted to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, Chandigarh. Chiranji Lal, Station House Officer (SHO), Sector-39 Police Station, confirmed that the attack appeared to be premeditated and due to a personal dispute.

But when public figures cross legal lines, the consequences unfold not just in courtrooms but also under the relentless scrutiny of the public eye. One name that recently forced this uncomfortable truth into the spotlight is Sean “Diddy” Combs, the hip-hop mogul and music industry titan who, after years of whispers and lawsuits, has now been convicted in a federal court. In July 2025, a jury found Combs guilty on two felony counts of transportation to engage in prostitution under the Mann Act, a law dating back to 1910. These charges relate to the coerced travel of his former partner, singer Cassie Ventura, and another woman identified only as “Jane,” both of whom testified during the trial. Combs was acquitted on three other charges, including racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking. Still, the guilty verdict marks a seismic fall for the 55-year-old artist once synonymous with glamour, success, and cultural dominance. Diddy’s story is far from unique. Over the years, several A-listers have been convicted of crimes — from drug possession and assault to manslaughter and tax evasion. This listicle delves into 10 high-profile celebrities with criminal records, focusing only on those with confirmed legal outcomes. Once a towering figure in global music, Diddy’s legacy has been rocked by criminal convictions. In a 2025 federal trial, he was found guilty of two counts of transporting women – including ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura – for prostitution, under the Mann Act. Though acquitted of more serious charges like racketeering and sex trafficking, the felony convictions carry serious legal and reputational consequences. More fallout may follow. Attorney Tony Buzbee claims over 100 men and women have accused Diddy of rape and assault. One woman alleged she was gang raped at age 17 after being drugged at a 2003 party. While Combs’s team dismisses the lawsuits as publicity stunts, the convictions have added weight to the mounting allegations. Sanjay Dutt’s conviction remains one of the most talked-about legal sagas in Indian cinema. In 1993, following the devastating Mumbai bomb blasts, Dutt was arrested under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) for illegally possessing an AK-56 rifle, which was part of a consignment linked to the bombings. Though he was acquitted of terrorism charges, he was convicted in 2006 under the Arms Act for illegal possession of firearms. After years of legal proceedings and appeals, Dutt was sentenced to five years in prison and ultimately served over four years, including time at Yerwada Central Jail. Before becoming Tony Stark, Robert Downey Jr. was one of Hollywood’s most tragic cautionary tales. Struggling with addiction in the 90s, Downey was repeatedly arrested for possession of heroin, cocaine, and unlicensed firearms. He was famously found wandering into a neighbour’s house under the influence and passed out in their bed. In 1999, after multiple probation violations, he was sentenced to three years in prison, though he served roughly a year before early release. In 2009, Bollywood actor Shiney Ahuja was arrested for raping his domestic help—a case that sent shockwaves through the film industry. Though the victim later recanted her statement, the court found the original testimony credible and convicted Ahuja in 2011 under Section 376 (rape) and other charges. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, though he spent about three years in jail before being released on bail pending appeal. Wesley Snipes’ high-flying Hollywood career hit a wall when he was convicted in 2008 on three misdemeanor counts of failing to file federal income tax returns. Prosecutors claimed he hadn’t paid taxes for years, despite earning tens of millions. Though he was acquitted of the more severe felony tax fraud charges, he still served nearly three years in prison. In 1992, boxing champion Mike Tyson was convicted of raping 18-year-old Desiree Washington, a beauty pageant contestant, in an incident that took place at a hotel in Indianapolis in July 1991. The jury found Tyson guilty after about 10 hours of deliberation, rejecting his defense that the encounter was consensual. Tyson was sentenced to six years in prison and served approximately three years before being released on parole in 1995. The conviction shocked the sports world and dramatically altered Tyson’s public image overnight, marking a significant turning point in his career. Despite this setback, Tyson later returned to the boxing ring and expanded his career into entertainment, including notable acting roles such as in The Hangover film series. In 2001, Stranger Things star Winona Ryder was arrested for shoplifting over $5,500 worth of merchandise from a Beverly Hills Saks Fifth Avenue store. She was later convicted of felony grand theft and vandalism, receiving three years’ probation, 480 hours of community service, and fines. The incident damaged her career for years, leading to a hiatus from leading roles in Hollywood. Ryder eventually made a well-received comeback, and her 2000s-era troubles are now often seen as part of the conversation around mental health and celebrity pressure. Shia LaBeouf is known for his acting talent as well as his history of erratic behaviour and legal troubles. Over the years, he has been arrested multiple times for offenses such as disorderly conduct, public intoxication, and drunk driving. One of the most notable incidents occurred in 2017, when LaBeouf was arrested in Savannah, Georgia, for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. During this arrest, he was caught on camera making a racially charged outburst toward police officers. These incidents, along with other arrests for similar behavior, have contributed to his reputation for instability. LaBeouf has also faced civil lawsuits from former partners, most prominently from singer FKA Twigs, who accused him of sexual battery and emotional abuse. While he has not been criminally convicted in these civil cases, the combination of his legal issues and public controversies has overshadowed his career achievements, leading many to view him as a cautionary example of wasted potential in Hollywood. Before becoming a blockbuster actor and producer, Mark Wahlberg had a violent and troubling past. At 16, Wahlberg was charged with attempted murder after assaulting two Vietnamese men during a racially motivated attack. He was convicted of assault and served 45 days in prison. The case drew renewed attention in 2014 when Wahlberg applied for a pardon, sparking criticism from civil rights groups and raising questions about accountability and privilege. Wahlberg has publicly acknowledged his past and expressed remorse, though his request for a pardon was ultimately dropped. Phil Spector, the music genius behind the Wall of Sound, became infamous for a far more sinister reason. In 2009, he was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2003 death of actress Lana Clarkson, who was found shot in his mansion. The trial, his second, after a hung jury, ended in a conviction and a 19-years-to-life prison sentence. Spector died in custody in 2021.",73697cd66a0be055d4dc8648c5cf018f30e228abbd24ff6c1604b1ab6fa4aac5,1676ed0148c17932b20d45559413e540

The doctor received two bullet injuries, and his condition is critical, they said. Ajay Gandhi, Senior Superintendent of Police, Moga, said Dr Aniljit Kamboj, who is in his fifties, was shot at by two men who came to his Harbans Nursing Home at around 2 pm. “The doctor was treating one of them, and discussing medicines when the second man who was standing behind opened fire. Two bullets hit the doctor, including one in the chest. He has been admitted to a private hospital in Moga, and his condition is critical. He is on ventilator,” Gandhi told The Indian Express. He said the police are probing the case from all angles, and checking CCTV footage to identify the suspects. A family member told The Indian Express that Kamboj had received extortion calls from Canada-based designated terrorist Lakhbir Singh Landa, an operative of the banned organization Babbar Khalsa International (BKI). The threat calls were being received since 2022 and the caller was demanding at least Rs 1 crore, said the family member, requesting anonymity. He further said that Kamboj was also given a security cover by the Moga Police but the lone gunman was withdrawn some months ago. Moga SP (investigation) Bal Krishan Singla, said: “An FIR was registered in 2022 after Dr Kamboj had received threat calls. Landa was nominated as an accused in that FIR.

The police said that the triple murders were in retaliation to a killing that occurred in November last year in connection with a feud between two families who belong to the same village. According to the police, Tugudi and his brothers had murdered a criminal identified as Somu Talikoti over a financial dispute and were released on bail recently. To avenge Talikot’s death, four of his brothers along with associates reportedly orchestrated Wednesday’s attack, the police said. “The police have been warning the families after the murder that took place last year. They belong to the same caste and are relatives. We suspect that these murders were carried out in revenge,” said Kalaburagi City Police Commissioner Sharanappa S D on Thursday.

The accused were riding a motorcycle with a temporary number plate when they were intercepted by the police. Police said that the arrests are linked to the firing incident that took place on the intervening night of June 20-21.

The accused — Sandeep Jawahar Shah, a resident of Solapur, and Salim Khubbuddin Patel, a resident of Navi Mumbai — were arrested in Mumbai and Sangli earlier this month. As per the CBI, it discovered that the two were involved in duping NEET candidates and their parents by falsely claiming to have connections with officials of the National Testing Agency (NTA) that conducts the examination. As per the CBI, Shah initially demanded Rs 90 lakh from each candidate and agreed to accept Rs 87.5 lakh per candidate. The central agency claimed that Shah and Patel would assure candidates that they would receive details of their purportedly increased marks six hours before the official declaration of results. The accused sought to be released on bail on the grounds that probe was completed and their custodial interrogation was not required. The pleas claimed that there was no recovery at the instance of the applicants and they’ll co-operate with the trial after being released on bail. The CBI, however, opposed the pleas stating that the same be rejected as there other accused persons are yet to be arrested and therefore the custodial interrogation of present applicants would be required. However, special judge VP Desai observed that till date (on June 21) “the investigating officer has nothing concrete to show that till what period the other accused will be arrested”. Merely because the other accused persons are yet to be arrested cannot be a ground for rejection of the bail, the judge added. The court further noted that offence under section 7(A) of Prevention of the Corruption (PC) Act is not punishable in imprisonment of life or death and punishment prescribed is not less than three years but will extend to seven years. “Nothing is brought on record against the applicant that he will not be available for trial.

NCRB 2015; PhD Scholar,murder,India; AI; Dalit; the United States; Chicago,the 18th century; working hours; 2019; the 1980s; 2018; 2022,,,,,,,"How AI in criminal justice could spark a human rights crisis for the marginalised Written by Roshan Pandey and Chetna Trivedi We are living in the era commonly referred to as Industry 4.0, where artificial intelligence and information technology are becoming part of almost every aspect of life. From education and healthcare to agriculture and criminal justice, governments around the world, including India, are using AI-based technologies with the claim of improving governance, efficiency and transparency. The purpose of technology, ideally, is to improve human life. But an important question remains: Who controls this technology? History reminds us that technological advancement does not automatically translate into better socio-economic conditions. For instance, when the steam engine was invented in the 18th century, it sparked a massive increase in industrial productivity. Logically, this should have reduced working hours and given people more leisure time. On the contrary, working conditions for labourers worsened. This contradiction occurred because the benefits of technology are controlled by the corporate class, who use it to extract labour without improving the workers’ well-being. The same pattern could repeat itself with AI, if we fail to examine “who” shapes and benefits from its development. AI and society: Shaped by bias AI in its current form reflects existing social biases — caste, gender, religion, skin colour, language, and region. A 2019 Guardian report found women are 47 per cent more likely to be seriously injured and 17 per cent more likely to die in car crashes, as cars and their safety systems are designed for male bodies. Sociologists Donald MacKenzie and Judy Wajcman introduced the concept of the “social shaping of technology (SST)” in the 1980s. The SST argues that technology is not neutral. It is influenced by the social, political, and economic environments in which it is developed. A 2018 MIT study found facial recognition systems had a 0.8 per cent error rate for White men, but 34.7 per cent for dark-skinned women. UN Women warns AI can amplify stereotypes across areas like hiring and healthcare. Studies show AI is not neutral and biased data harms marginalised groups. In criminal justice, this could trigger serious human rights issues. Who represents India’s database? In India, there is no specific legal framework to regulate the use of AI. Yet tools are being widely adopted by both government and private institutions. Large language models and generative AI systems operate on existing datasets, but these datasets themselves are shaped by unequal access. The CSDS 2019 report pointed out a deep digital divide in India. A significant part of the population, especially women, Dalits, Adivasis, minorities, and rural communities — has limited or no access to the Internet. Oxfam’s India Inequality Report 2022 found that women use the Internet 33 per cent less than men. Only 31 per cent of rural Indians are online, compared to 67 per cent in urban areas. The situation is even more skewed when it comes to caste, with “upper” caste people having far more representation in digital spaces than Dalits and Adivasis. This means that the data on which AI systems in India are trained does not fairly represent the country’s social reality. As a result, AI tools built on such biased datasets risk reinforcing existing inequalities. AI in criminal justice: A threat to the marginalised? The NCRB’s Prison Statistics 2018 reveals deep inequalities in India’s justice system: Two-thirds of prisoners are Dalits, Adivasis, or OBCs, 19 per cent are Muslim, and 66 per cent are illiterate or have not studied beyond class X. NCRB 2015 data shows over 55 per cent of undertrials come from Dalit, Adivasi, or Muslim backgrounds. This raises concerns about using AI in criminal justice, as biased data can reinforce existing discrimination. Recent examples highlight these risks. The Punjab and Haryana High Court used ChatGPT in a bail rejection for a murder case, setting a troubling precedent. Amazon’s 2014 AI hiring tool, scrapped for bias against women, shows how AI can replicate past injustices. In India, where power in government, corporates, and media is concentrated among the privileged, AI in recruitment and policing without ethical safeguards could further marginalise vulnerable communities. Experts often argue that developed countries possess more advanced AI systems to control crime, whereas developing nations lack the tangible and human resources needed to use such technologies effectively. However, even in the United States, AI-driven systems have demonstrated significant flaws. For instance, the COMPAS algorithm used in the criminal justice system has been shown to be twice as likely to assign higher risk scores to Black defendants compared to White defendants charged with similar offenses. Similarly, the NAACP has raised concerns on the Chicago crime prediction algorithm and its inherent systemic bias against Black communities. These examples highlight the misuse of AI-based technologies that disproportionately affect marginalised groups and violate their human rights. The central government in India is increasingly deploying tech-based tools in the criminal justice system. Notable initiatives include the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS), a nationwide database of crimes and offenders; the Inter-operable Criminal Justice System (ICJS), which enables information sharing among various state institutions; and the National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS), designed to assist in identifying suspects and missing persons. However, the use of such systems in the absence of a well-defined legal and regulatory framework raises concerns. These measures may reinforce systemic bias and lead to further marginalisation of communities that already lack adequate representation and voice within institutional records. The need for inclusive and ethical technology India holds enormous diversity but also deep inequalities. The databases currently used in AI development do not reflect the complexities of Indian society. While AI has many exciting possibilities, it also raises serious ethical and social questions that must be addressed before it is adopted widely. Therefore, the government must enact regulations to ensure AI remains inclusive, transparent, and accountable. Technology must not reinforce existing stigmas and exclusion and rather become a tool for empowerment.

Miss, he said, after the woman — assuming it was a phone number from a love struck businessman — dropped the note unread into her purse. You’d better look at that note. I have a bomb. For good measure, he opened the briefcase to show her several red cylinders, connected by a wire.Cooper wanted $US200,000 ($305,910), an amount equal to $US1,591,781 ($2,434,697) in today's currency.He wanted it in a knapsack by 5pm. He also wanted two sets of parachutes — implying he intended to take a hostage.The plane would land at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and there the money would be brought aboard, Cooper told the flight crew.Then, and only then, would the 35 passengers be free to go.A leap from a plane launches a decades-long FBI manhuntUltimately the plane circled Seattle for two hours — during that time, many passengers later told media they didn’t even know what was going on.Richard Simmons, head of a prisoner-rehabilitation program, told reporters he slept most of the time we were up there . I saw one stewardess answer a call and her face dropped, he said. She looked bewildered and gulped. I guess she learned what was happening then. His wife, Barbara, worried they may have gotten on the wrong plane. First we went right past Seattle, then Everett, she said. All I could think of was the plane was going to Vancouver and we were on the wrong flight. On the ground, the FBI and the Seattle Police Department rushed to get the money, parachutes, and emergency personnel ready for the landing.The plane landed at 5.46pm, and the money was handed over by an airport staffer — 10,000 unmarked $20 bills in a cloth bag.The passengers got off. The flight attendants retrieved the parachutes. He told them he didn’t need the instructions on how to use them.The plane took off again a few hours later with only Cooper and the flight crew aboard, followed by three fighter jets.This time it was heading for Mexico City, but the hijacker would not make it that far.The black tie DB Cooper left behind on the plane he hijacked. (Supplied: FBI)As the plane travelled somewhere between Seattle and Reno around 8pm, Cooper ordered the flight attendants to open the staircase at the back of the plane.Then he tied the bag of money around his waist, donned his parachutes, and jumped.It was the end of the hijacking, but only the beginning of an investigation that would continue for decades.Suspects, interviews and a $30,000 hoax The new files released this month are the latest in a series to be declassified under the Trump administration.The first lot of more than 400 pages were published online in March.Bundles of crumbling $20 bills from DB Cooper's ransom money were unearthed by a small boy on a sandbar in the Columbia River in 1980. (Supplied: FBI)The documents, at times heavily redacted, outline leads and suspects pursued by the FBI over the years.At one point, a man in a wheelchair became their key suspect, only to be ruled out. It is believed that the hijacker in this case has full use of all of his extremities and witnesses did not tell of any physical disability, the agent wrote. A man confined to a wheel chair [sic] did not hijack the plane in this case. Other men investigated included former pilots and members of multiple different skydiving clubs who bore a resemblance to Cooper.Men who did not resemble the artist’s sketch but who had mentioned different ways to hijack an airplane or suggested the way to hijack [and] escape would be … using a parachute were also reported to police.Several documents include long and redacted lists of suspects whose photographs were shown to witnesses without success.A contributing editor for Newsweek magazine, Karl Fleming, told the FBI he had placed an ad in multiple newspapers asking DB Cooper to contact him.Heists that shocked the worldThe plane hijacking by DB Cooper is just one of a series of high-profile robberies which have hit the headlines around the world.The ad included his home phone number.He said he had been contacted and met multiple times with a man who identified himself as Cooper.At one point, he said he had been shown several $20 bills he said he was 98 per cent positive matched copies of the ransom money shown to him by an unknown source.He handed over $US30,000 ($45,810) for the exclusive interview, publishing a three-part series detailing Cooper’s side of the story.Two men were later convicted and sentenced to serve time in federal prison for impersonating Cooper and pocketing the money.The rest of the files do not draw any definitive conclusion.'DB Cooper, Where Are You?' In the years since the hijacking, the story has become part of American pop culture history.By 1972, T-shirts bearing the phrase DB Cooper, Where Are You? were already appearing in novelty shops across the west coast.A magazine cover featuring DB Cooper published in 1976, included in National Archives files. (National Archives)There have been dozens of fiction and non-fiction books about the case, as well as references in film and television.In David Lynch’s 1990 TV series Twin Peaks, the main character is named Dale Bartholomew Cooper — a nod to the now infamous hijacker.More recently, DB Cooper was revealed to be Loki in the Disney+ series Loki, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.An annual CooperCon convention is held in Seattle, letting Cooper enthusiasts and researchers swap theories.None of it has led to any answers.Max Shaffer, then chief of security for the Seattle region of the Federal Aviation Administration, told the New York Times in 1972 he believed Cooper was dead. I feel that one of these days some hunter in Oregon or Washington is going to find the skeleton of this man, he said.As of July 12, 2016, the FBI had officially ended their investigation, leaving it as one of the longest cold cases in the agency’s history. The mystery surrounding the hijacking of a Northwest Orient Airlines flight in 1971 by a still-unknown individual resulted in significant international attention and a decades-long manhunt, they said in a statement. Evidence obtained during the course of the investigation will now be preserved for historical purposes at FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC.

(Facebook)Their intelligence on Mr Ayik came after he was unwittingly recruited into spreading a police-bugged app, called AN0M, into the underworld by the AFP.The joint AFP and FBI operation involved planting the devices into the hands of criminals and watching on as they used it to organise murders, drug shipments and beatings in Australia and abroad.No AN0M cases against anyone charged in Australia have ever revealed what, if any, link they had to Mr Ayik, deepening the mystery of who one senior law enforcement source described as a Mr Big of the underworld .But a trove of court documents from the United States, released in recent months, reveal his alleged role in luring his mates into the police trap.The man behind the 'Oscar' monikerAs part of their investigation the AFP revealed how rival bikies and crime families would work together using AN0M to supply drugs all over Australia.In court documents from related AN0M cases in the United States, prosecutors described Mr Ayik as an influencer — a role that proved a profitable side hustle.In one filing referring to Mr Ayik under his AN0M username Oscar , one of his associates described how all the profits from the sale of 100 devices would go straight to him.Alleged Australian drug lord Hakan Ayik poses in a Facebook profile photo. (Facebook)That transaction would earn him $75,000 in Bitcoin, according to court documents.The same underling, the documents said, would go on to discuss in messages on the device how Mr Ayik and the crew could start a VIP service for certain AN0M customers.Others paint the picture of Mr Ayik as being the go-to person for AN0M, who would go on to sell more than 12,000 devices as well as allegedly leading the Comanchero from overseas.The Comanchero are one of the most powerful bikie gangs in Australia, who suffered a power struggle during Sydney's recent gangland war.What the AN0M device looked like, before it was revealed to be a police Trojan horse app. (Supplied: AFP)In another court document from the United States, an underling asks Mr Ayik: Touching base with you in relation to AN0M device we prepared for client Tiger? Another describes how Mr Ayik is alleged to have sent clients to those under him and how those clients paid cash through a family member of Mr Ayik.When news of the AN0M operation first broke, rumours from underworld and police sources purported Mr Ayik had fled for his safety to either Syria or Iraq.Two years later in 2023, 46-year-old Mr Ayik would be apprehended shirtless by Turkish police in a posh apartment belonging to him in the heart of Istanbul.Hakan Ayik, during his now infamous capture in Istanbul in 2023. (Reuters: Turkish Interior Ministry/Handout )Charges with a 262-year jail termMr Ayik lived a life of luxury while on the run in Türkiye, though the alleged drug kingpin will likely never face justice down under.Among the lavish hotels, cars and businesses in Istanbul, Mr Ayik was far from going to ground while wanted for a raft of serious drug offences across the globe.Vast swathes of his wealth have now been seized by Turkish authorities who are prosecuting him for a series of alleged drug crimes and money laundering offences.If convicted he faces 262 years in prison.Mr Ayik was rumoured to be a billion-dollar bikie while posting flashy social media snaps on the run and estimates of his wealth ranged from $250 million to as high as $1 billion.The former Sydney bikie is also wanted on a racketeering indictment in the US and appears on watch lists for police authorities from Europe to Australia.Hotels fit for a kingThe Kings Cross Hotel in Istanbul, owned by alleged Sydney crime boss Hakan Ayik.

(Supplied: Supreme Court of Western Australia)Instead, the pellets hit and killed Ralph Matthews Cox, who did not know Nguyen-Ha and had no involvement in the drug world.The jury deliberated for two days before finding Nguyen-Ha guilty of one charge of murder, as well as five counts of doing an act likely to endanger life.Final act in series of shootingsDuring his trial, Nguyen-Ha admitted firing the gun twice but claimed he replaced the shotgun shells with pellets filled with rock salt.He told the court it was his alleged accomplice, Matthew Gempton, who fired a third, fatal shot with a different gun.Gempton, a self-described debt collector, already received a reduced sentence for manslaughter over his role in the shooting after agreeing to be a key witness in Nguyen-Ha's trial.He admitted being Nguyen-Ha's driver in the shooting but said it was his accomplice who fired the gun.Police found Ralph Matthews Cox critically injured at a house in Landsdale in January 2022. (ABC News)The intended target of the shooting, Anthony Prior, admitted in court he had bashed Nguyen-Ha and stolen tens of thousands of dollars from him in late 2021, in a set-up which involved fake drugs.That triggered two earlier shootings at homes in Perth's northern suburbs in which Nguyen-Ha, along with Gempton, were targeting Prior.The prosecution maintained that in those shootings Nguyen-Ha was not a mere bystander but was a planner, and that he was indeed the lone gunman in the final Landsdale shooting.On that night, Mr Cox and his partner were asleep in their front bedroom and stirred when they heard someone outside.He said I've been hit , when he was shot, the court heard.Nguyen-Ha will face a sentencing hearing on August 22.

He wasn't anticipating that that man was going to come out the window and run like he did, he said. They've taken evasive action pretty quickly, and obviously we have seen the collision. It certainly wasn't a deliberate course of action as a way to arrest our offender. He said it was not yet clear how many cars were damaged during the pursuit. It wasn't a pursuit for the entirety of what was going on … there were periods were it just being followed by the air wing. There were some computers in the car that were being tracked, he said.

(ABC News: Che Chorley)In short:A teenager has been sentenced for his role in the ambush attacks on three men who were enticed to meetings via social media under the guise of sexual encounters.The 17-year-old did not orchestrate the meetings, but participated and did not attempt to stop it.What's next? The teenager was spared convictions but ordered to participate in family conferencing and placed on a six-month good behaviour bond.abc.net.au/news/teen-sentenced-for-vigilante-ambush-attacks/105511878Link copiedShareShare articleA teenager involved in vigilante attacks on men lured to meet-ups via social media under the guise of sexual encounters, has been spared convictions for his crimes.The now 18-year-old, was sentenced in Adelaide's Youth Court this week for his involvement in two separate ambushes instigated by his lifelong friend .In sentencing, Magistrate Tracee Micallef said the teen's friend had pretended to be an underage girl on social media and had sexualised conversations with a man aged in his 30s, before luring him to meet in person. The victim thought he was meeting to engage in a sexual interaction with what he thought was a young girl, she said.Ms Micallef said the teenager, who was 17 at the time, only became involved in the offending when his friend invited him to the planned meeting with the man in February. The [friend] came to you and said he had organised to meet up with a paedophile, Ms Micallef said. You agreed to go with him without making any further inquiries as to what was planned or what was happening … you clearly knew that a confrontation was likely to occur. 'Humiliating and degrading' act filmedDuring the confrontation, which involved a group of youths, the man was threatened with a machete and blocked from leaving.Ms Micallef said the man was forced to transfer money to one of the other youths' accounts, and told to remove his shirt and kiss the shoes of the group or he would be assaulted.The man initially refused and was punched. As he was in fear, he did what was asked of him and it was filmed — that is the humiliating and degrading act, Ms Micallef said.She said the victim fled and later tried to have the money returned via his bank but stopped the investigation when he received threats that the footage and embarrassing messages would be released to his family and workplace.Ms Micallef said the victim would always have a concern that the video footage of him is still out there in the cloud somewhere .She said the teen had agreed he was equally responsible for the offending despite not being the instigator or the planner .The teenager had pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated robbery, blackmail and engaging in humiliating or degrading filming in relation to that incident, along with aggravated robbery and attempted aggravated robbery in relation to a second incident in April this year.The men were lured to meet with the youths via social media. (AP: Jenny Kane)Ms Micallef said the second incident involved ambushing two men who were lured to a public area, for what they thought would be a sexual experiment, or interaction, with a third male .She said the two men saw someone in the dark , and were asked, but refused, to go back to their house or a school before they were threatened with a machete.A group of youths, including the now-18-year-old, assaulted the men — one of whom was put in a headlock — and tried to take their keys and wallets, but the men escaped and alerted the police.Ms Micallef said the teen was again not involved in the set-up, nor wielding the machete or making threats but was willingly present.She said the teen — who had spent about two weeks in youth detention after his arrest — had a stable home life, was well-behaved at school and had provided multiple glowing character references to the court.The magistrate said the teen had recognised that despite being long-time friends, the youth who organised the meetings was now a negative influence on your behaviour .'Vigilante behaviour is not acceptable'She said the court had been told that aside from his close friend, he did not know the other youths involved and had been dragged into the offending. Whilst I can accept that the first time you joined your childhood friend you may have not been aware of the planned robbery or humiliation or blackmail … but you did participate in it, she said. You did not leave, nor did you try to stop it. Even if you did nothing but stand there, by your presence you made it frightening for the victim and supported the others in that action. I can also accept that to some extent you may have thought that you were dealing with, or somehow punishing someone who was behaving inappropriately, or about to. However, this behaviour cannot be condoned in any way … this type of vigilante behaviour is not acceptable. Ms Micallef diverted the youth to family conferencing for the offences against the first victim and imposed a six-month good behaviour bond for the second incident. She did not impose any convictions.Posted Thu 10 Jul 2025 at 8:05pmThursday 10 Jul 2025 at 8:05pmThu 10 Jul 2025 at 8:05pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesŚwiątek beats Anisimova in just 57 minutes to win Wimbledon titleTopic:TennisPhoto shows Iga Swiatek celebratesDonald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradePhoto shows Donald Trump speaking to the media in the White House Press Room.No review of accused childcare abuser's work check despite red flagsTopic:Child CarePhoto shows Joshua Brown in a childcare centre.Man shot dead by police at shopping centre in Sydney's westTopic:PolicePhoto shows Three police officers in bulletproof vests walk away from the camera through a shopping centre car park at sunsetKonstas dismissed cheaply as Australia fights for runs in day-night TestLIVEPhoto shows A man holds a cricket bat with his hand on his forehead.Popular nowDonald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradePhoto shows Donald Trump speaking to the media in the White House Press Room.Świątek beats Anisimova in just 57 minutes to win Wimbledon titleTopic:TennisPhoto shows Iga Swiatek kisses the Wimbledon trophyRescuer describes moment she discovered lost German backpacker Topic:Missing PersonPhoto shows A profile photo of a young woman with long dark hair and brown eyes Related topicsAdelaideCourtsCrimeLaw, Crime and JusticeSASentencingTop StoriesŚwiątek beats Anisimova in just 57 minutes to win Wimbledon titleTopic:TennisPhoto shows Iga Swiatek celebratesDonald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradeNo review of accused childcare abuser's work check despite red flagsTopic:Child CareMan shot dead by police at shopping centre in Sydney's westTopic:PoliceKonstas dismissed cheaply as Australia fights for runs in day-night TestTopic:CricketJust InUnlocking the 'hidden and radical' power of First Nations womenTopic:Indigenous Culture26m ago26 minutes agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 8:30pm'Stigmatised and hidden': What drives the compulsive urge to steal?Topic:Mental Health56m ago56 minutes agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 8:00pmA late-night phone call, a frantic flight and a baby in need of a mum Topic:Adoption56m ago56 minutes agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 8:00pm'We need to hold on': Tuvalu's fight for survival finds home in AustraliaTopic:Climate Change1h ago1 hours agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 7:31pmMore Just InBack to top Świątek beats Anisimova in just 57 minutes to win Wimbledon titleTopic:TennisPhoto shows Iga Swiatek celebrates Donald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradePhoto shows Donald Trump speaking to the media in the White House Press Room.

The prosecutor alleges the three acted in agreement, motivated by revenge against the teenager.What's next? The judge has told the jury they must reach a unanimous verdict for each accused who faces three charges. abc.net.au/news/charlie-gander-supreme-court-murder-trial-jury-deliberates/105517906Link copiedShareShare articleA jury has begun deliberating in the trial of three people accused of kidnapping, murdering and burning the body of a 19-year-old in northern Victoria in December 2022. The remains of Charlie Gander's body were found in a burnt-out car at Bunbartha on Christmas Eve, 2022.Kylie Stott, Dimitri D'Elio and Danny Clarke have pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, murder and arson in a trial painted by the prosecution as a desire for revenge against Charlie for ratting out their associate to the police.The jury was shown photos taken by Victoria Police of the burnt car, which contained the remains of Charlie Gander's body. (Supplied: Supreme Court of Victoria)At the time of the alleged offending, Ms Stott was aged 37, Mr D'Elio 24 and Mr Clarke 38.All three have pleaded not guilty.The 12 jurors have begun deliberating after 30 days of hearings, including about 41 witnesses made up of pathologists, DNA experts, emergency services and police officers. The jury also heard statements read out by the prosecutor from Mr Gander's girlfriend and his father Richard Gander, including final texts between the pair. Police evidence cost teenager 'dearly', says CrownIn his final address, Mr Gibson argued that each of the accused was guilty of the three charges because each of them was part of an agreement, arrangement or understanding with the others to kidnap Charlie Gander, to murder Charlie Gander and to burn the Ford Territory with Charlie Gander's body in it .Mr Gibson told the jury the alleged motive was Mr Gander's cooperation with police investigating a firearms breach by Tyson May, who was a good friend of Ms Stott. Mr Gander was also friends with Mr May and would hang out with him, the court heard.Following a police raid in Shepparton in November 2022, Mr Gander gave a police interview and made a witness statement about Mr May possessing a firearm. The court heard Gander's body contained high levels of ice, which could not be ruled out as a cause of death. (Supplied: Gander family)Mr May was under a firearms prohibition order, Mr Gibson said. A disc with the record of Mr Gander's police interview found its way into the hands of others , Mr Gibson said. It cost him dearly, he said.The court heard a kitchen knife wrapped in a bloodstained tea towel from under a car seat had a mixed DNA profile of four people, including Mr Gander. Forensic pathologist Paul Bedford, who conducted Mr Gander's autopsy, previously told the court extensive fire damage to the body meant the cause of death could not be ascertained.He also told the court toxicology reports had found very high levels of the drug methylamphetamine, commonly known as ice, which may have contributed to Mr Gander's death.Defence arguments Justice Michael Croucher presented a summary of the defence counsel's arguments to the court before the jury began deliberating.Daniel Sala, acting for Ms Stott, has rejected the prosecution's arguments that she was key in orchestrating the acts against Mr Gander and urged the jury to find her not guilty of murder or arson. Paul Kounnas, acting on behalf of Mr D'Elio, has argued Ms Stott and Mr Clarke were the prime movers in the alleged crimes and that Mr D'Elio was dragged along and used as a patsy . Emergency services found the car on fire on a dirt road in Bunbartha in Victoria's north. (Supplied: Supreme Court of Victoria)The court heard Mr D'Elio, who was in a relationship with Ms Stott, did not know Mr Gander or Mr Clarke and had no skin in the game .Christopher Terry, acting on behalf of Mr Clarke, has argued his client did not intend to kill Mr Gander or enter into any agreement to do so. He said there was no evidence of Mr Clarke's hatred towards Mr Gander or proof of an agreement, and that his client had been dragged into a terrible crime .Charges heard togetherJustice Croucher instructed the jury that they must reach a unanimous verdict for each of the accused, who each face three charges. The jury heard they may find the accused guilty of manslaughter as an alternative if they are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the higher charge of murder. Justice Croucher told the jury manslaughter did not require an intent to kill, but there must be an intentional assault that was dangerous and posed serious injury. He also told the jury their task did not include making moral judgements.He noted jurors had been tasked with not one trial but 12 separate decisions, with the three accused facing three charges and the potential for manslaughter. The 12 charges are being heard together for convenience, and the jury must not allow this fact to usurp justice and must consider each charge separately, Justice Croucher said.Posted Thu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:39amThursday 10 Jul 2025 at 9:39amThu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:39am, updated Thu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:41amThursday 10 Jul 2025 at 9:41amThu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:41amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesŚwiątek beats Anisimova in just 57 minutes to win Wimbledon titleTopic:TennisPhoto shows Iga Swiatek celebratesDonald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradePhoto shows Donald Trump speaking to the media in the White House Press Room.No review of accused childcare abuser's work check despite red flagsTopic:Child CarePhoto shows Joshua Brown in a childcare centre.Man shot dead by police at shopping centre in Sydney's westTopic:PolicePhoto shows Three police officers in bulletproof vests walk away from the camera through a shopping centre car park at sunsetKonstas dismissed cheaply as Australia fights for runs in day-night TestLIVEPhoto shows A man holds a cricket bat with his hand on his forehead.Popular nowDonald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradePhoto shows Donald Trump speaking to the media in the White House Press Room.Świątek beats Anisimova in just 57 minutes to win Wimbledon titleTopic:TennisPhoto shows Iga Swiatek kisses the Wimbledon trophyRescuer describes moment she discovered lost German backpacker Topic:Missing PersonPhoto shows A profile photo of a young woman with long dark hair and brown eyes Related topicsBunbarthaCourtsCrimeMelbourneSheppartonTop StoriesŚwiątek beats Anisimova in just 57 minutes to win Wimbledon titleTopic:TennisPhoto shows Iga Swiatek celebratesDonald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradeNo review of accused childcare abuser's work check despite red flagsTopic:Child CareMan shot dead by police at shopping centre in Sydney's westTopic:PoliceKonstas dismissed cheaply as Australia fights for runs in day-night TestTopic:CricketJust InUnlocking the 'hidden and radical' power of First Nations womenTopic:Indigenous Culture26m ago26 minutes agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 8:30pm'Stigmatised and hidden': What drives the compulsive urge to steal?Topic:Mental Health56m ago56 minutes agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 8:00pmA late-night phone call, a frantic flight and a baby in need of a mum Topic:Adoption56m ago56 minutes agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 8:00pm'We need to hold on': Tuvalu's fight for survival finds home in AustraliaTopic:Climate Change1h ago1 hours agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 7:31pmMore Just InBack to top Świątek beats Anisimova in just 57 minutes to win Wimbledon titleTopic:TennisPhoto shows Iga Swiatek celebrates Donald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradePhoto shows Donald Trump speaking to the media in the White House Press Room.

Ms McGuire was reported missing by her family in April last year, and her body was later found in a burnt-out vehicle south-west of Ballarat. Hannah McGuire, 23, was found dead inside a burnt-out vehicle in April last year. (Supplied: GoFundMe)In opening remarks, chief prosecutor Kristie Churchill told the court Ms McGuire's three-year relationship with Mr Young was controlling and turbulent , and included a series of intervention orders.In one instance, Ms Churchill said Mr Young called Ms McGuire 129 times in a single day.The prosecution will argue that Mr Young murdered Ms McGuire at the Sebastopol home they once shared, before putting her body in the footwell of a car, driving her out to a remote location, and setting both on fire. Ms Churchill told the court that autopsy reports concluded Ms McGuire was dead before the fire started. The prosecution said it would argue Mr Young staged Ms McGuire's death to look like a suicide and systematically deleted evidence.The prosecution rejected Lachlan Young's guilty plea to manslaughter. (Instagram)It is alleged Mr Young seized Ms McGuire's phone post murder and sent text messages as Ms McGuire to her mother and himself. I'm sorry mum, I thought this was the right decision. I tried to heal and cope with it all but I'm not ok, read the beginning of one text Mr Young sent from Ms McGuire's phone to her mother.The prosecution will also argue Mr Young transferred thousands of dollars to Ms McGuire's mother and himself and continued to spread a bunch of lies to friends, family, and police in the days after her murder.Floral tributes were left for Hannah McGuire at the site where her remains were found. (AAP: Con Chronis )Charge of murderMr Young's defence, led by Glenn Casement, told the court the 22-year old man made a very serious admission pleading guilty to manslaughter.Mr Casement said although Mr Young made a series of appalling, bad choices in an attempt to obscure what he did, he did not kill Ms McGuire with murderous intent .The Supreme Court will sit in Ballarat for the next five weeks. (ABC News: Julia Bergin)The defence will argue Mr Young's actions were foolish and shameful , but Ms McGuire's death was an unplanned and spontaneous event .Throughout the next five weeks, the court will hear from a number of witnesses, including friends, family, medical experts, and the man who assisted Mr Young to dispose of the car containing Ms McGuire's body. What's next?A jury of 14 was empanelled on Wednesday morning and will be required to make a unanimous decision, beyond reasonable doubt, on whether Mr Young murdered Ms McGuire.There are four key elements they need to satisfy: that Mr Young caused the death of Ms McGuire, that he did so consciously, voluntarily and deliberately, that he intended to kill or cause serious injury, and that there was no lawful justification or excuse for his actions.

(Supplied: NSW Police)Assistant Commissioner Gavin Wood on Wednesday said the scam preyed on the cultural fears of the victims. They have been compromised by people of their own nationality, Assistant Commissioner Wood said. The evidence will be alleged that they have come from China into Australia to commit these crimes and then return. Assistant Commissioner Wood said those targeted were some of the most vulnerable in the community, who in total have made off with $3 million. They, I would describe, are very, very vulnerable people, he said. The majority are female and elderly. They underpin the word vulnerability. And that's what makes this scam, this crime, let's not call it a scam, this crime, so serious. They are like piranhas; they are circling around vulnerable people and they are robbing them, at times, of huge amounts of money. Loading...A 63-year-old woman was arrested at Sydney International Airport on July 3.A 62-year-old man, who was arrested by the Australian Federal Police at Brisbane Airport the following day, was successfully extradited to NSW yesterday.They both face three charges, including participate criminal group contribute criminal activity .Footage of victims 'extremely sad'Assistant Commissioner Wood said police believed there may be victims of the scam who have not come forward to police and urged anyone who had been targeted to come forward.He said the footage police have of the victims allegedly being scammed was extremely sad . There's no rules with these people; they're predators. When they see an opportunity, when they need to work as a group they will work as a group, he said. It is extremely sad to see how they act, targeting individuals who are vulnerable, who are elderly. They have no chance. Police released photos of those accused of being involved in the operation in the hope people with information on their whereabouts and alleged involvement in the group will come forward.Posted Wed 9 Jul 2025 at 4:31amWednesday 9 Jul 2025 at 4:31amWed 9 Jul 2025 at 4:31am, updated Wed 9 Jul 2025 at 5:58amWednesday 9 Jul 2025 at 5:58amWed 9 Jul 2025 at 5:58amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesŚwiątek beats Anisimova in just 57 minutes to win Wimbledon titleTopic:TennisPhoto shows Iga Swiatek celebratesDonald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradePhoto shows Donald Trump speaking to the media in the White House Press Room.No review of accused childcare abuser's work check despite red flagsTopic:Child CarePhoto shows Joshua Brown in a childcare centre.Man shot dead by police at shopping centre in Sydney's westTopic:PolicePhoto shows Three police officers in bulletproof vests walk away from the camera through a shopping centre car park at sunsetKonstas dismissed cheaply as Australia fights for runs in day-night TestLIVEPhoto shows A man holds a cricket bat with his hand on his forehead.Popular nowDonald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradePhoto shows Donald Trump speaking to the media in the White House Press Room.Świątek beats Anisimova in just 57 minutes to win Wimbledon titleTopic:TennisPhoto shows Iga Swiatek kisses the Wimbledon trophyRescuer describes moment she discovered lost German backpacker Topic:Missing PersonPhoto shows A profile photo of a young woman with long dark hair and brown eyes Related topicsCrimeHornsbyParramattaPoliceSydneyTop StoriesŚwiątek beats Anisimova in just 57 minutes to win Wimbledon titleTopic:TennisPhoto shows Iga Swiatek celebratesDonald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradeNo review of accused childcare abuser's work check despite red flagsTopic:Child CareMan shot dead by police at shopping centre in Sydney's westTopic:PoliceKonstas dismissed cheaply as Australia fights for runs in day-night TestTopic:CricketJust InUnlocking the 'hidden and radical' power of First Nations womenTopic:Indigenous Culture26m ago26 minutes agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 8:30pm'Stigmatised and hidden': What drives the compulsive urge to steal?Topic:Mental Health56m ago56 minutes agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 8:00pmA late-night phone call, a frantic flight and a baby in need of a mum Topic:Adoption56m ago56 minutes agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 8:00pm'We need to hold on': Tuvalu's fight for survival finds home in AustraliaTopic:Climate Change1h ago1 hours agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 7:31pmMore Just InBack to top Świątek beats Anisimova in just 57 minutes to win Wimbledon titleTopic:TennisPhoto shows Iga Swiatek celebrates Donald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradePhoto shows Donald Trump speaking to the media in the White House Press Room.

The court heard the attack on March 20, 2024, targeted businesses linked to Ukraine and was planned by agents of Wagner Group, acting on behalf of Russian military intelligence.The warehouse targeted by the trio stored aid and Starlink satellite devices vital for Ukraine's defence against Russia's continuing invasion.The jury found Jakeem Rose, Ugnius Asmena and Nii Mensah guilty of aggravated arson. (AP/Metropolitan Police)CCTV shown to the court showed Rose and Mensah near the warehouse shortly before setting fire to it.The fire caused around 1 million pounds ($2 million) worth of damage. A fourth man, Paul English, 61, was cleared of any wrongdoing.Prosecutors said the attack was orchestrated by Dylan Earl, 21, and Jake Reeves, 23, who had previously pleaded guilty to aggravated arson on behalf of the Wagner Group.Dylan Earl, left and Jake Reeves, right, pleaded guilty to orchestrating the attack on behalf of Wagner. (AP/Metropolitan Police)Earl also became the first person convicted under the National Security Act when he admitted his role in a plot targeting a wine shop and restaurant in London's upmarket Mayfair district, with plans to kidnap the owner, a high-profile critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.Earl exchanged hundreds of messages with an apparent Wagner handler who encouraged him to find links with soccer hooligans, Irish republican militants and high-profile criminal groups.Arson is latest Russia-linked incidentThe arson attack was the latest incident involving allegations of malign activity by Moscow in Britain.Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the London police's Counter Terrorism Command, said both plots involving Earl showed the Russian state projecting activity into the United Kingdom .He said Russia and other states such as Iran had adapted to British authorities' response to hostile activity, with some 20 per cent of counterterrorism police's work coming from foreign states.The warehouse in East London was storing Starlink satellite equipment bound for Ukraine. (AP/Metropolitan Police) We've made the UK a hostile operating environment for those governments but, as a result, they've diversified and are now contacting relatively young people to act on their behalf as proxies in doing their activity, Commander Murphy said.The Kremlin has denied the accusations, and its embassy in London has rejected any part in the warehouse fire, saying the British government repeatedly blames Russia for anything bad that happens in Britain.In March, a group of Bulgarians were convicted of being directed by Wirecard fugitive Jan Marsalek to spy for Russian intelligence.British authorities say that, since the expulsion of Russian spies following the 2018 poisoning of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal, Moscow has had to rely mainly on criminals motivated by financial gain, or those with existing grievances, to carry out activities on its behalf.AP/ReutersPosted Tue 8 Jul 2025 at 3:31pmTuesday 8 Jul 2025 at 3:31pmTue 8 Jul 2025 at 3:31pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesŚwiątek beats Anisimova in just 57 minutes to win Wimbledon titleTopic:TennisPhoto shows Iga Swiatek celebratesDonald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradePhoto shows Donald Trump speaking to the media in the White House Press Room.No review of accused childcare abuser's work check despite red flagsTopic:Child CarePhoto shows Joshua Brown in a childcare centre.Man shot dead by police at shopping centre in Sydney's westTopic:PolicePhoto shows Three police officers in bulletproof vests walk away from the camera through a shopping centre car park at sunsetKonstas dismissed cheaply as Australia fights for runs in day-night TestLIVEPhoto shows A man holds a cricket bat with his hand on his forehead.Related storiesA 'reckless campaign of Russian sabotage' has been uncovered.

Today, the body of former Transport Minister Roman Staravoit was found in his private car with a gunshot wound in the Odintsovo district, the Investigative Committee said in a statement. The main version [considered] is suicide, it added.Russian state media and news agencies said Mr Staravoit shot himself.There were conflicting reports about the timing of his death.Various Russian media cited law enforcement sources as saying a pistol belonging to Mr Starovoit had been found alongside his body in his car.Just hours earlier, a presidential decree announced Mr Starovoit's departure after barely a year in the job, but gave no reason for his dismissal.The statement read: Roman Starovoit was relieved of the post of Minister of Transport. Political analysts and Russian state media speculated after his sacking that he may have been dismissed in connection with an investigation into corruption in the Kursk region, which he was governor of for over five years.In April this year, Mr Starovoit's successor as governor, Alexei Smirnov, was charged with embezzling money earmarked for defence purposes amid accusations that the funds earmarked for border defences had been stolen, leaving Kursk more vulnerable to Ukrainian attack.Roman Starovoit served as the transport minister under Russian President Vladimir Putin. (Reuters: Sputnik/Alexander Kazakov)Ukrainian forces launched a counteroffensive in Kursk last year, three months after Mr Starovoit left his role as governor to become transport minister.Mr Starovoit's firing also came after another weekend of travel chaos at Russian airports following Ukrainian drone attacks.Pressed earlier on Monday by reporters on whether his dismissal meant Mr Putin had lost trust in Mr Starovoit over Kursk, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said a loss of trust is mentioned if there is a loss of trust . There is no such wording in the [Kremlin] decree.

I was away for three days and came back and the house was open, Mr Camilleri said. As soon as I saw my [1954 Gibson] Switchmaster missing, I realised I'd been burgled. Joe Camilleri says his Gibson Switchmaster ES5 was stolen from his home. (Supplied: Ian Ritter)The ARIA Hall of Fame inductee said five Gibson guitars were taken, which had been part of his life for at least 40 years and were used to write many famous songs. I pull them out and they're my best friends, Mr Camilleri said.As well as the Switchmaster, a 1956 Gibson L5, 1960 Gibson 330, 1967 Gibson Les Paul cherry top and 1975 Fender Stratocaster were taken.The thieves also allegedly took off with the musician's cutlery, bathroom products, yellow wheelie bin and a leaf blower. I couldn't work out the weirdness of it all, Mr Camilleri said.It's not the first time he's had gear stolen.In 2017 a guitar, saxophone and amplifier were taken from the back of his car.They were recovered ready to be shipped overseas, a fate he believed had probably befallen his beloved guitars too. I'd say if the people who took them are smart enough they'll be in a container on their way to Dubai now or somewhere like that, Mr Camilleri said.Joe Camilleri says the guitars are like his best friends . (Supplied: Ian Ritter)Victoria Police said detectives were investigating the burglary and the unknown offenders forced entry to the home around 10.30pm on July 3.The Black Sorrows used social media to ask the music fraternity to keep an eye out for the gear and alert guitar resellers. These are distinct instruments and will be difficult to offload, the band's Facebook post said.Anyone with information or security footage is asked to contact Crime Stoppers.ABC Central Vic —local news in your inboxGet our local newsletter, delivered free each TuesdayEmail addressSubscribeYour information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement.Posted Mon 7 Jul 2025 at 8:33amMonday 7 Jul 2025 at 8:33amMon 7 Jul 2025 at 8:33amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesŚwiątek beats Anisimova in just 57 minutes to win Wimbledon titleTopic:TennisPhoto shows Iga Swiatek celebratesDonald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradePhoto shows Donald Trump speaking to the media in the White House Press Room.No review of accused childcare abuser's work check despite red flagsTopic:Child CarePhoto shows Joshua Brown in a childcare centre.Man shot dead by police at shopping centre in Sydney's westTopic:PolicePhoto shows Three police officers in bulletproof vests walk away from the camera through a shopping centre car park at sunsetKonstas dismissed cheaply as Australia fights for runs in day-night TestLIVEPhoto shows A man holds a cricket bat with his hand on his forehead.Related storiesGurrumul's stolen guitar, music equipment foundTopic:CrimePhoto shows A haul of stolen music equipment spread out in an office.First COVID stopped him from playing gigs.
