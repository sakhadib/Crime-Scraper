Suarez pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit bank and mail fraud, along with aggravated identity theft. He faces several years in prison, including mandatory-minimum punishment of two years for the ID theft conviction, at his sentencing hearing in September before U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams.Suarez was indicted in 2023 but was living in Panama City, Panama, at the time. In early 2025, he was arrested in Panama and brought to South Florida to face the charges. According to a factual statement filed with his plea agreement, here’s how Suarez carried out the scam during an FBI-led undercover operation:More than 80 fraudulent checksIn March 2022, Suarez told a confidential informant that he had access to the bank account of an elderly person, who was 82 years old at the time. Suarez created and mailed dozens of falsified checks from Panama to South Florida to the victim’s bank with directions to cash them and return half of the money to his account at Bank of America. The ill-gotten proceeds were wired to his Miami-based company, Online Electronics.To carry out the scheme, Suarez’s fraudulent checks contained forged signatures designed to resemble that of the victim’s on a signature card at Truist Bank.“In total, Suarez and his co-conspirators stole $803,146 from [the victim’s] bank account at Truist through the issuance of more than 80 fraudulent checks to numerous different payees, including at least five individuals and various companies,” according to the factual statement signed by the defendant, his lawyer and a prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami.The statement also said the elderly person reviewed the names of the individuals and companies involved in the fraudulent check transactions. The person did not authorize any of them.The case, investigated by the FBI, Secret Service and FDIC’s Office of Inspector General, was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Thor Pogozelski.This story was originally published July 10, 2025 at 11:32 AM.

He was the father of two children. The driver was arrested Tuesday, July 8, 2025. GoFundMe Andres Roberto Fiallos Estupiñan, accused of running down and killing a father who was jogging in his Shenandoah neighborhood, was booked into jail Tuesday after he was released from Jackson Memorial Hospital, where police had to Taser him to subdue him, his attorney said.Fiallos Estupiñan had been hospitalized since June 10 after suffering a broken ankle while fleeing the scene of the fatal hit-and-run at Southwest 21st Avenue and 18th Street. Residents tackled him near Shenandoah Park after they say he struck 50-year-old jogger Andrew Loretta with a Volkswagen Jetta, then careened into an ice cream truck and several other vehicles before attempting to run away.Jail records show that Fiallos Estupiñan, 36, was hit with multiple charges, including leaving the scene of the crash involving death, leaving the scene of a crash with serious bodily injury, reckless driving and vehicular homicide. READ MORE: Suspect in Miami hit-and-run unconscious for weeks after hospital clash with copsPsychotic episode caused the tragedy, attorney saysFiallos Estupiñan was hospitalized for weeks and listed in critical condition, leaving his family and attorney reeling with questions on how his condition deteriorated when he went in for a broken ankle. His attorney, Bradley Horenstein, said Fiallos Estupiñan — who has a history of mental health issues — had a psychotic episode that started before the crash.“This unimaginably tragic case is the result of Mr. Fiallos Estupiñan having suffered a psychotic break, which the hospital spent weeks successfully treating with medication,” Horenstein told the Miami Herald Wednesday.According to Horenstein, Fiallos Estupiñan became agitated while handcuffed to a hospital bed and attempted to get up and leave. A Miami police officer stationed at his bedside Tasered Fiallos Estupiñan multiple times to subdue him. When that had little effect, hospital staff gave him ketamine, an anesthetic used for surgery, and Estupinan was intubated for his safety. A psychiatric evaluation conducted at the hospital provided further detail on the severity of Fiallos Estupiñan’s condition. According to the five-page report, he ripped out his IV line, jumped out of bed naked while handcuffed and set off a hospital alarm after throwing himself against a wall vent.Horenstein said doctors continued to sedate him as he was not responding to medications for the psychosis. Further, Fiallos Estupiñan developed pneumonia and a bacterial infection in his lungs, which landed him in critical condition and the Intensive Care Unit. Andres Roberto Fiallo Estupinan, accused of the hit-and-run death of a Shenandoah father out for a jog on June 10, was jailed Tuesday, July 8, 2025. He’s facing a slew of charges. Estupinan family photo For three weeks, Horenstein was unable to speak to his client due to the heavy sedation.At one point, doctors performed a tracheotomy to avoid long-term damage to his vocal cords from prolonged intubation. Horenstein noted the situation was so dire that his client’s mother was granted a humanitarian visa to fly to the U.S. and sit by his bedside.“The hospital and the City of Miami Police Department were very accommodating,” Horenstein said.Fiallos Estupiñan was slowly weaned off the sedatives as the anti-psychotic medication began to take effect; he is now lucid and calm, Horenstein said.Set to be released on conditionsFiallos Estupiñan appeared in Miami-Dade Bond Court on Wednesday before Judge Gisela Cardonne Ely in an orange jumpsuit with a visible cast on his leg. At the hearing, prosecutors said Fiallos Estupiñan was driving 75 miles per hour in a 25-mph residential zone at the time of the crash. They argued he is both a danger to the community and a flight risk.Prosecutors requested Fiallos Estupiñan’s total bond be set at no less than $100,000 and that if released, he be placed on house arrest, be barred from driving and have his passport confiscated.Horenstein pushed back, telling the judge his client is not a danger to himself or others, but made no arguments on the $100,000 bond. He noted that Fiallos Estupiñan had been hospitalized for nearly a month after the crash and is a commercial engineer by profession. His mother and sister were present in the courtroom.The judge set bond at $25,000 for each charge, for a total of $100,000. She also ordered Fiallos Estupiñan to be placed on Level 2 house arrest, meaning he can only leave home for work, church or meetings with his lawyer.Fiallos Estupiñan, who was born in Ecuador and lived in Chile, was also ordered to surrender his passport before being released from jail. Horenstein said the passport was believed to be inside Estupinan’s car, which has been impounded as evidence by the Miami Police Department.Despite that, Judge Cardonne Ely said the passport must be turned over before Estupinan could walk out of jail. Prosecutors asked Horenstein to provide proof the passport was not in his client’s possession. The judge removed the passport confiscation condition after Horenstein said he confirmed with the Miami Police sergeant supervising the case that the passport was in their possession.Witnesses held him downAccording to his arrest affidavit, Fiallos Estupiñan was driving a gray 2012 Volkswagen Passat on June 10 at a “high rate of speed” southbound on Southwest 21st Avenue near 17th Street just before 7 p.m. Police say he had an expired Florida driver’s license.At the same time, Andrew Loretta, 50, was jogging along the west side of 21st Avenue, heading toward 18th Street.Surveillance footage shows Fiallos Estupiñan striking the jogger from behind with such force that Loretta was thrown into the air and both of his legs were severed.After hitting Loretta, Fiallos Estupiñan crashed into a white 2013 Nissan ice cream van that was stopped at 21st Avenue and 18th Street, serving children at Shenandoah Park. Police say Estupinan made no “visible attempt to brake” before the impact.The Volkswagen then struck two more parked vehicles: a gray 2019 Toyota and a white 2023 Mercedes SUV, both on the west side of 21st Avenue near the park.Two witnesses told police that Fiallos Estupiñan immediately got out of the car and ran away without trying to help the injured jogger or calling 911. He ran into Shenandoah Park, where several bystanders stopped him and held him down until officers arrived.Loretta was pronounced dead at the scene. Estupinan had a broken ankle, while a passenger in one of the hit cars had a skull fracture.A beloved community memberIn Miami’s Shenandoah neighborhood, just off Coral Way, the sudden death of Loretta—a married telecommunications executive and father of two teenagers—has left his family heartbroken and the community in shock. Friends and relatives described him as an avid jogger and soccer enthusiast who moved to Miami from California in 2000. He was fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.A GoFundMe page to support Andrew’s family has raised over $193,000 with just over 900 donations.“I hope that justice is served. Not only for Andy, but for the family ... At the end of the day [Andres] has to deal with his own karma. I honestly feel a lot of compassion for him. It’s just a terrible situation,” John Loretta, Andrew’s cousin, who lives in Kendall, said.The Loretta family, including his wife and children, said in a statement through their attorney that they are grateful for the support they have received.“This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the Loretta family, and they remain deeply grateful for the outpouring of support from family, friends, and the community,” Raul Chacon, the family’s attorney, said in a statement to the Miami Herald. “At this point, they will have no further comment on the ongoing legal proceedings. Thank you for respecting their privacy and understanding their need to grieve in peace. “Miami Herald writer Isabel Rivera contributed to this report.This story was originally published July 9, 2025 at 4:17 PM.

Miami Police are not saying what they’re doing to bring him back. Jason Getz Jason Getz-USA TODAY Sports A month after being charged with attempted murder, former NFL star Antonio Brown has posted videos on social media flaunting his lavish lifestyle abroad — riding around in expensive cars and sauntering on a yacht overlooking Dubai’s skyscrapers.It’s almost as if Brown, 37, were taunting police. But Miami Police will not say whether they consider Brown on the run — or if they’re working to bring him back to the U.S. to face trial.A Miami-Dade judge signed off on Brown’s arrest warrant a month ago. But police don’t appear to be looking for him and refuse to discuss the case. There’s also no record or court date for Brown in the database of Miami-Dade circuit court records.READ MORE: Antonio Brown charged with attempted murder after shooting at Miami boxing eventIn a video uploaded to X on Thursday, Brown is seen celebrating his birthday in a red Ferrari 812 GTS and hanging out with his young sons on the water.

After the shooting, Brown said on social media that he was attacked by people trying to steal his jewelry.

The jewelry designer spent a month in jail in the United Arab Emirates, documents show, before proving that Brown lied.READ MORE: Antonio Brown’s false accusations put Miami jeweler in Dubai jail for month: lawsuitPeople accused of crimes usually negotiate with authorities to surrender upon their return. Brown had an attorney early on who secured him a $10,000 bond, including house arrest. As of Thursday, it’s unclear if Brown was being represented by an attorney. Another unknown: whether prosecutors will continue to honor the bond agreement in place. Brown could be detained by the FBI or U.S. Marshals if Miami Police or the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office request that the federal agencies issue a warrant for Brown’s return, said Jeffrey Sloman, a Miami criminal defense attorney who served briefly as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. This is usually accomplished through a federal charge brought forward if a person is avoiding prosecution. If a person remains a fugitive, they may not be granted bond to get out of jail, or a judge could be more harsh in their confinement, Sloman said. The attorney said to look no further than his client Ohad Fisherman, who was on his honeymoon in Japan but returned quickly to address the criminal charge against him. Fisherman — who was entangled in one of the cases brought by the state against the Alexander brothers — had a sex crime charge against him dropped on Monday by state prosecutors.READ MORE: Alexander brothers’ friend cleared in sex case — tearful, angry at state prosecutors“It’s in [Brown’s] best interest to come back immediately, so hopefully the judge would give him a reasonable bond so he can fight the charges out of jail,” Sloman said. “It’s very difficult to fight a case in jail. If Mr. Brown continues to avoid prosecution, eventually he will travel somewhere or to some place and he will be arrested.”Padilla told the Herald police likely believe that Brown will return to South Florida because he has property and children in the area. Formally extraditing Brown, he said, would be costly.

Daniel A. Varela dvarela@miamiherald.com “It’s not easy for the FBI to be dragging people from the Middle East,” Padilla said. “There’ll be a point that if this continues, it could manifest into something larger.”Brown should contact an attorney to turn himself in, Padilla said, because a judge could factor in the amount of time he was abroad after the warrant was signed when deciding his bond. “This is a serious crime. This isn’t going to go away,” Padilla said. “...He’s going to have to face these charges.” Grethel Aguila Miami Herald Go to X Email this person Grethel covers courts and the criminal justice system for the Miami Herald.

Once limited to Southeast Asia, the criminal model is spreading — and uses AI.https://p.dw.com/p/4whWKOnline scam centers were initially concentrated in Cambodia, with additional trafficking hubs later uncovered in Laos and MyanmarImage: Kyodo News/IMAGOAdvertisementHuman trafficking-fueled scam centers have significantly expanded their operations worldwide, according to a crime trend update released on Monday by the international police agency Interpol. Hubs where trafficking victims are forced to take part in online fraud first emerged in a few Southeast Asian nations, but investigators are now also uncovering similar fraud centers in other regions. Where are scam centers spreading? According to the international police organization, victims now come from 66 countries across all continents, highlighting what Interpol describes as a global crisis involving hundreds of thousands of people. Scam centers are now increasingly found in other regions, including the Middle East, West Africa — fast emerging as a new regional hub — and Central America. Victims are often lured with fake job offers and then held captive in scam compounds. Many are blackmailed over alleged debts, beaten, sexually exploited, and in some cases tortured or raped. Inside these centers, they are forced to run online scams, mostly targeting people abroad to steal money.Freed captives describe scam operations in MyanmarTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video A 2024 Interpol-led operation exposed dozens of cases where victims were coerced into committing fraud, including a raid on an industrial-scale scam centre in the Philippines. That same year, police dismantled a centre in Namibia where 88 youths were forced to scam others. Emerging technologies are fuelling this trend further. The crime update notes a surge in the use of artificial intelligence, from generating fake job ads to creating deepfake profiles for sextortion and romance scams. Who are the victims? Interpol says the pool of those preyed upon has widened significantly. While early human trafficking victims were mainly Chinese-speaking and came from China, Malaysia, Thailand or Singapore, people are now being trafficked to such hubs from South America, East Africa and Western Europe. Tackling this rapidly globalizing threat requires a coordinated international response, said said Interpol's acting head of police services Cyril Gout. Who are the people traffickers? The report found that about 90% of human trafficking facilitators came from Asia, while 11% were from South America or Africa. About 80% of these facilitators were men, with 61% aged between 20 and 39. Online scam centers were initially concentrated in Cambodia, with additional trafficking hubs later uncovered in Laos and Myanmar. Today, similar operations have been identified in at least four more Asian countries, and evidence shows the model is spreading to other regions such as West Africa, where cyber-enabled financial crime is already common. In its findings, Interpol warned that the spread of such criminal networks needs urgent, coordinated action to disrupt trafficking routes and support victims. Interpol said that these criminal hubs are increasingly intertwined with other major transnational crimes, demanding a globally coordinated response.

Here's how the death cap became the center of a chilling murder case. https://p.dw.com/p/4x8P8Even small amounts of death cap mushrooms are lethal if consumed.Image: Hans Reinhard/Okapia/picture-allianceAdvertisementA jury in Australia has found Erin Patterson guilty on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder. The murder weapon: Toxic mushrooms. Prosecutors argued Patterson intentionally served four of her family members with meal portions containing toxic death cap mushrooms in 2023. Patterson denied being guilty, originally telling police she had used store-bought mushrooms from a supermarket, then an Asian grocer in Melbourne. A search of such stores found no evidence that poisonous mushrooms had ever been sold. During the trial, Patterson said she may have foraged for the mushrooms but could not say for certain where she had obtained the death caps. Why are death cap mushrooms so deadly? Deadly by name and by nature, death cap mushrooms (Amanita phalloides) are full of a highly stable toxin called alpha-Amanitin. The toxin is so stable that it won't break down when exposed to heat in cooking. When a death cap is eaten, people don’t usually feel symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea until at least 6 hours later. During this time the alpha-Amanitin toxins are making their way through the bloodstream into organs of the body. The toxin primarily acts in the liver, where it causes cells in the liver to die. Alpha-Amanitin binds with RNA polymerase-II enzymes, preventing the cells from creating new proteins. Eventually, the liver starts to shut down. Death can occur within 24 hours. Careful identification required The Amanita genus of fungi is well-known for their toxic properties. This group include the fairytale toadstool commonly known as the fly agaric, death caps, and destroying angels . But some other Amanita mushrooms are edible. Most cases of death cap poisoning are often a case of misidentification — their classic white appearance and domed cap looks like many other types of fungi. Identification of mushrooms requires a knowledge of different parts of the anatomy: the cap or fruiting body, the gills or spores beneath the cap, and the stipe — or stalk. While death caps look like many other mushrooms, one defining characteristic is their bad smell. They don't store well at all, unless you dehydrate them. They quickly go very stinky and very nasty, Brett Summerell, a fungi expert and Chief Scientist at the Botanic Gardens of Sydney, Australia, told DW. Because of the risk of misidentification by amateurs, it's usually recommended that foragers go for edible species that cannot be mistaken. Of course, foraging under the supervision of a trained mycologist — a fungi scientist — is usually a safe option. The famous red and white toadstool is a member of the Amanita genus, and a cousin of other deadly mushroom species.Image: FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP No death caps in the supermarket The jury ultimately didn’t find Patterson’s defense — that she mixed up foraged mushrooms in the same container as store-bought ones — believable. The prosecution argued Patterson knowingly put the toxic mushrooms in the home-cooked lunch and disposed of evidence. Summerell said the likelihood that death caps could get into store-bought products is, to be honest, farcical. The reason? Death caps only grow next to oak and beech trees. Death caps, like many fungi, are mycorrhizal, meaning they have a symbiotic relationship with the tree species. Death caps obtain their nutrients from nearby tree roots and return nutrients to the nearby soil. But because they can only grow at the base of oak and beech trees, it means there's no chance of them sprouting in a commercial setting, where spores are cultivated in highly controlled conditions — and with no trees in sight. Australia could get rid of death caps Death caps aren’t native to Australia, and neither are the oak and beech trees that support them. The trees were first introduced into Australia from Europe in the 19th ecntury, and death caps in the 1960s. Summerell and other mycologists are now discussing the possibility of removing oak trees in some parts of Australia. We have argued that, in Sydney, if it's at all possible, we should start to think about removing oak trees from some of these suburbs just from the point of view of a public health risk, said Summerell. Removing introduced oaks could harbor positive benefits, both from a public health perspective by removing the risk of the top cause of mushroom poisoning, as well as providing more space for native Australian plant life.

But some criminologists doubt the figures.https://p.dw.com/p/4wuVjShoplifting is on the rise, say retailersImage: Carsten Milbret/imageBROKER/picture allianceAdvertisementGermany has never had more shoplifters than in 2024. An annual survey of 98 retailers estimates a 3% increase on the year before — amounting to some €4.95 billion ($5.84 billion) in losses. The latest study by Germany's Retail Institute (EHI) on inventory differences shows that the vast majority of those losses (€4.2 billion) was down to theft from customers, employees, or delivery workers, the EHI said, which would mean losses of some €570 million to the public purse through lost sales tax. The EHI also said that retailers had to resort to balancing out their losses and the costs of extra security by increasing prices. Study author Frank Horst calculated that some 1.5% of prices in stores could now be attributed to covering theft and security. Shoplifting techniques The EHI said there had also been a 5% increase in organized shoplifting, which accounted for a third of the total shoplifting losses. Horst said this could be individual thieves working their way through a shopping list, or else, the thefts could be carried out by coordinated groups. One of them drives a vehicle, one of them distracts the staff, or shields the one putting the goods away so they can't be seen, Horst told DW. Sometimes so-called depots are set up in the store, where all the goods are packed in a bag, and then someone else carries it out in a surreptitious moment. The survey does not include exact breakdowns of the kinds of articles that get stolen, but Horst says that thieves often target anything small, expensive, and that can be easily re-sold, such as perfume and cosmetics. There had also been a rise in the theft of foods, especially relatively expensive things like meats and cheeses. But Nicole Bögelein, a criminologist at Cologne University, cast doubt on how useful the study actually is. She told DW that the researchers estimate that 98% of cases aren't even discovered. So it's just an assumption that the majority of these losses can be attributed to theft, she said. Bögelein also cast doubt on the EHI's conclusion that there are more organized shoplifting gangs, as that could simply be because store detectives are more on the lookout for such groups. 'Poverty crimes' Despite its shortcomings, the annual EHI survey is one of the few shoplifting studies there are, and it is focused mostly on the economic impact. Bögelein, by training a sociologist as well as a criminologist, has a different perspective and says that almost all cases of shoplifting are so-called poverty crimes — defined as crimes that don't cost any money to carry out, and are committed by people because they have no money. Bögelein's own investigations into shoplifting have found that the people who are caught are often poor — possibly, she says, also because store detectives are more likely to keep an eye on people who look poor. Official statistics suggest that the majority of thefts from shops are relatively petty. According to German federal police statistics, in 66.7% of discovered and prosecuted thefts, the value of the items stolen was under €50 and in 40.2% of cases even under €15. The punishment is usually a small fine, or, if the fine can't or won't be paid, a prison sentence. Germany a 'paradise' for shoplifters? Horst described Germany as a paradise for shoplifters, as the punishments are often relatively mild. Though theoretically thieves can be imprisoned for up to five years, he said that in practice first-time offenders are often not charged at all. Bögelein said that deterrence might have an effect on some minor thefts, but was generally skeptical of the idea that more punishment discourages petty crime. People don't not steal because they're scared of punishment, she argued. In criminology, we find that people stick to rules because they think those rules are correct and because they fear a bad conscience if they don't stick to them. Public transport operators in Germany often charge people a fee for riding without a ticket, but may also press charges, especially for repeat offenders.Image: picture-alliance/dpa/J. Wolf Should shoplifting be decriminalized in Germany? There has been a debate among German criminologists about to what extent poverty crimes should be decriminalized altogether, on the grounds that such crimes are usually victimless and therefore don't require criminal justice. There have long been calls to downgrade one classic poverty crime — riding public transport without a ticket — to a misdemeanor, partly because punishing it has become a burden to public coffers and is clogging up the justice system. Between 8,000 and 9,000 people end up in prison in Germany every year for riding without a ticket. But Horst argued that shoplifting shouldn't always be defined as a poverty crime: The EHI estimates that two-thirds of shoplifting cases were what he called opportunistic perpetrators, and many of them are not necessarily poor. Horst does think that inflation and higher prices for basic items may be playing a role in the rise of shoplifting, but he was reluctant to accept that poverty was the driving element of all theft. It could be a protest theft, because people are saying they're not prepared to accept the price rises for a particular product, he said, I'm sure poverty is a part of it, but that it explains the rise on its own — I don't see that.

Kenyan government's latest finance bill avoided the tax hikes that sparked weeks of protests in mid-2024. Rights groups say over 60 people were killed and dozens more were illegally detained by security forces in the aftermath. The protests peaked when thousands stormed parliament on June 25, 2024 when lawmakers debated the unpopular finance bill. The bill is now expected to take effect on July 1, 2025. But demonstrations picked up again over the death of 31-year-old teacher and blogger Albert Ojwang, who died in police custody earlier this month. Protesters want a senior officer they blame for the death to resign.

Why is there a market for her content in the Balkan country and how are some Bulgarians fighting it?https://p.dw.com/p/4vrvKOn her social media profiles, Bulgarian influencer Zornitsa Gyutsova posts misogynistic advice about how men should 'deal with' womenImage: Zgyutsova/TikTokAdvertisement Women love men who can be violent if need be. That's why they like men who hit them, Bulgarian influencer Zornitsa Gyutsova tells her followers. Gyutsova suggests that not only do women prefer men who physically assault them, but that this is also the way men should behave because a woman should respect a man's physical power since she is unable to comprehend his intellectual power. This is the kind of advice that can be found on Gyutsova's social media profiles and in a private group founded by her on Telegram called Upstanding Man. 'Equality is contrary to human nature' Zornitsa Gyutsova offers her followers private chats over video where she teaches them how to deal with women — for a fee, of course. Many influencers, life coaches and other online personalities in Bulgaria and elsewhere offer private sessions or courses. What makes Gyutsova's content stand out from the rest is that its sole purpose is to explain to men that they need to learn to control their partners both psychologically and, if necessary, physically.There have been numerous protests against violence against women in Bulgaria in recent years, such as this one in 2023Image: Alexandar Detev/DW In Gyutsova's view, men in general have been treated badly by women, and women are the ones who exert violence on men, namely by not paying them enough respect. The idea of equality is like a worm in people's brains that insists men and women should be partners […] which is so contrary to human nature that it can never work, Gyutsova declared in a long video about her work that was broadcast on Bulgarian National Television. Although the broadcaster, which is partly financed by taxpayer's money, has since removed the video from its platforms, it has never publicly commented on the case. Huge backlash Gyutsova's profiles on social media have been gaining traction for several years now. Screenshots and videos from her private Telegram group chat recently surfaced on social media, triggering a huge backlash in Bulgaria. Local woman Petya Krasteva was so appalled by Gyutsova's online content that she filed a complaint against Gyutsova with the prosecutor's office. On her social media channels, she not only encourages people to degrade women and use violence against them, she also boasts that she uses the same methods on her child and her cat, she told DW. I thought to myself: This is not only absolutely unacceptable, it's criminal. Gender discrimination not a crime in Bulgaria Many other women did the same as Krasteva, only to find out a couple of weeks later that their efforts had been in vain.Petya Krasteva was appalled by Zornitsa Gyutsova's online content and filed a complaint against her with the prosecutor's officeImage: Nikola Gyulmezov In an official reply, the prosecutor's office stated that nothing could be done because Bulgaria's criminal code does not define gender discrimination as a crime and that the issue was a matter for the Commission against Discrimination. Krasteva promptly lodged a complaint with this commission, but received another negative answer based on the same reasoning. Profiles briefly taken down Although these complaints did not lead to charges being brought against Gyutsova, the backlash did have an impact. The outcry and the fact that Gyutsova's social media accounts were reported by people who found their content abhorrent, meant that the influencer's TikTok and Instagram profiles were deactivated. They were, however, reactivated a short time later. Impunity for abusers Krasteva feels that part of the reason why content like Gyutsova's strikes a chord in Bulgaria is that while patriarchal norms and domestic violence are not accepted in the country, Bulgarian society often turns a blind eye to them. The other huge problem, she says, is that as with many other social issues, there is a complete lack of consequences for the perpetrators. Valentina Dimitrova, a psychologist who works for the Emprove Foundation, a Bulgarian organization that supports women who have suffered domestic violence, holds a similar view.Psychologist Valentina Dimitrova says that content like Gyutsova's is dangerous because 'it can truly cost a human life'Image: Venera Velkovska Sadly it's embedded in the Bulgarian mindset that we often just accept that things are bad and we do nothing about it, says Dimitrova. She believes that this is also why many women stay in violent relationships: They simply have no faith in the authorities because time and time again, men who beat or even kill their partners face no legal consequences. Although some people seem to think that social media content is less problematic than actual abuse in real life, Dimitrova stresses the dangers associated with such content: It can truly cost a human life. A global online problem Misogynistic online content that paints women as lesser human beings and men as oppressed by women is not unique to Bulgaria. Such content has been growing and spreading all over the world in recent years. Influencers like Andrew Tate, who faces charges of rape, bodily harm, human trafficking and more, have created a whole movement around this sort of content. Gyutsova fits neatly into this category of influencer, but what makes her different is that she is a woman. What role does feminism play? Dimitrova thinks one issue here is that feminism is often misunderstood. Feminism does not entail men being suppressed and women controlling them. It means that women can have equal rights and can function as equals to men not only in society but also in their personal relationships, she says. Dimitrova also believes that the patriarchal notion that men should not be allowed to express emotions is highly problematic. This is reflected in Gyutsova's content, which suggests that men are weak and not manly if they dare to express their fears, emotions or feelings.People in Sofia attend a protest against domestic violence and violence against women in Bulgaria in 2023 after a young woman was stabbed by her ex-partner Image: Alexandar Detev/DW It's a vicious circle: Men who are not allowed to express any sort of emotion for fear of being labeled weak don't know what to do when they experience something frustrating in their relationships and so they resort to aggression, says Dimitrova. What can be done? Dimitrova suggests that first and foremost, men should receive support and their concerns should not just be swept under the carpet. She stresses, however, that this support should not validate the inclination to deal with problems by exerting psychological or physical violence on women. Although the Emprove Foundation focuses primarily on women's rights and issues, it does have a project that focuses on men's mental health — something the foundation says is incredibly important in the fight against gender-based violence. Men should be encouraged to connect to a healthy understanding of themselves, so they can build healthy relationships as well, says Dimitrova. Petya Krasteva firmly believes that even though authorities in Bulgaria rarely provide the support needed in cases like this, society should not remain indifferent. We should be as loud as possible when something like this turns up, she says. We should be perfectly clear that it is unacceptable.

Why did an Argentinian court ordered an international warrant for her arrest?https://p.dw.com/p/4uJX3Aung San Suu Kyi has been imprisoned by the Myanmar military since 2021 (archive picture from 2012)Image: Loviny Christophe/ABACA/picture alliance AdvertisementIt is rare for an international arrest warrant to be issued against a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and political prisoner whose release is demanded by both the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council. However, this is precisely what occurred in February this year, when an Argentinian court asked for the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi. The court's decision applies to 25 Myanmar citizens wanted on charges linked to genocide and crimes against humanity. The list includes not only Myanmar's military leader Min Aung Hlaing, but also former State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and former President Htin Kyaw. Suu Kyi effectively served as Myanmar's top civilian leader before the military staged a coup in February 2021. She has been imprisoned ever since. The court in Argentina claims it has the jurisdiction to order a warrant for Suu Kyi's arrest based on a legal principle that some serious crimes can be prosecuted regardless of where they were committed. The specific case focuses on discrimination against Myanmar's Rohingya ethnic minority. The Muslim Rohingya live predominantly in the western state of Rakhine, and their status as citizens and as an ethnic group recognized by the state of Myanmar has been disputed for decades. The Rohingya crisis of 2017 Since 1988, Myanmar has seen an ongoing political conflict between the military and military-backed parties on one side and Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, on the other. In 2016, after many years of stalemate, the military and Aung San Suu Kyi reached a truce. A kind of dual government was established, with Aung San Suu Kyi heading the civilian branch and Min Aung Hlaing heading the military, which had constitutionally secured independence and far-reaching political rights. On October 9, 2016, Rohingya insurgents attacked several border and police posts of the Myanmar security forces. In August 2017, the security forces launched so-called clearance operations. As a result, thousands of Rohingya were killed and around 700,000 fled to neighboring Bangladesh, with exact figures still unclear due to the nature of the ethnically-charged conflict. Rohingya refugees fear increased hardship due to aid cutsTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video While the military denied using excessive force, international watchdogs and the UN agree that Myanmar's actions against the Rohingya constitute grave human rights violations. Still, two questions remain: First, did the offensive amount to genocide? Second, how much of it was the responsibility of Aung San Suu Kyi? The question of genocide Concerns that a genocide was happening in Myanmar have already been voiced before 2017. In 2015, the human rights organization Fortify Rights published a report with the Allard K. Lovenstein International Human Rights Clinic from Yale Law School in which was stated that there is strong evidence that genocide is being committed against Rohingya. Those voices only grew louder after 2017, and in November 2019, Gambia initiated a case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Myanmar, claiming violations of the UN's Genocide Convention. The ICJ has yet to rule on the case, however, meaning that the existence of genocide remains unconfirmed in a legal sense. But for human rights organizations like Fortify Rights, the Burmese-Rohingya Organization UK (BROUK) and the former UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar, Tomas Ojea Quintana, there is no doubt that genocide did take place. Quintana, an Argentinian, told Radio Free Asia that the court in his native country understood what was at stake, which is the genocide against the Rohingya people. The question of responsibility Aung San Suu Kyi was a globally renowned human rights advocate since the early 1990s until the events of 2017. She was also heading Myanmar's civilian government during the deadly wave of violence against the Rohingya. As chief councilor, she was notably hesitant to speak out against the military and even went to The Hague in 2019 to defend Myanmar at the International Court of Justice. She denied genocide was happening in Rakhine but admitted human rights violations, which would be investigated by Myanmar. She later confirmed this position in an interview with the Financial Times. War crimes were committed during the internal armed conflict with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army by members of Myanmar's security forces and civilians, she told the paper. At the same time, Aung San Suu Kyi pointed to a report by the Independent Commission of Enquiry (ICOE) which was set up by Myanmar without Rohingya representatives. The ICOE found no evidence of genocide, she told the paper, despite its report recording killing of civilians, disproportionate use of force, looting of property, and destruction of abandoned homes of Muslims. For those who believe Myanmar troops committed genocide against the Rohingya, Aung San Suu Kyi's refusal to recognize it makes her complicit. But does her stance — admitting that human rights violations happened but not genocide — mean Aung San Suu Kyi is guilty of committing genocide? What do we know about the Argentinian court order? The reasons behind the Argentinian court's decision to seek an international arrest warrant are not fully clear, as neither the ruling nor the exact evidence on which the ruling was based are publicly available. DW contacted the Argentinian court and the Argentinian human rights commission to get more information in the matter, but received no reply. The 2021 coup triggered protests in Myanmar, which eventually escalated into a civil war.Image: Sai Aung Main/AFP In the months following the announcement, Myanmar expert and former ambassador Derek Tonkin published an academic paper on the issue, examining the sources which most likely led to the arrest warrant. He writes that the petition [on which the decision of the court seems to be based] contains much narrative and opinion which are debatable and questionable, and in some areas are simply wrong. Commenting on the claim that Aung San Suu Kyi and others validated the genocide against the Rohingya, Tonkin states, it is not true and is supported by no evidence anywhere in the petition. Tonkin also rejects the accusation that Aung San Suu Kyi was directly responsible for the events in Rakhine State during her time as state counsellor at the time. I find this totally unconvincing. The Tatmadaw [the Myanmar military] refused to accept Aung San Suu Kyi's appointment, he writes. So far, the arrest warrant hasn't had any impact. Aung San Suu Kyi seems set to celebrate her 80th birthday next month as a prisoner in Myanmar as the civil war rages on. With the passage of time, the international arrest warrant might end up as a mere footnote in a long political career filled with legal battles.

Sanjay Verma was shot dead on Monday at around 10 am, right outside his showroom in Abohar. According to eyewitnesses, three motorcycle-borne assailants lay in wait for him. The moment Verma stepped out of his car, they opened indiscriminate fire, killing him on the spot before fleeing the scene. While the shooters escaped and have yet to be identified, the Punjab Police announced the arrest of two of their accomplices, Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan, both residents of Patiala district, for helping the shooters escape in the car. However, within hours, both men were killed in a police encounter. This development has added fuel to the controversy. BJP General Secretary Manjinder Singh Sirsa accused the Punjab government of mishandling the law and order situation. On his visit to Chandigarh Wednesday, Sirsa said, “First of all, the Punjab government is not able to control the law and order and criminals… Punjab has become a police state. If Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has a clean image, he should get a CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) inquiry conducted into these encounters so the truth comes out.” Reacting sharply, AAP’s Punjab state president Aman Arora called the BJP’s stance “extremely shameful,” accusing it of siding with gangsters instead of supporting Verma’s bereaved family. Arora said, “While the entire Punjab stands with the family of Shri Sanjay Verma, Manjinder Singh Sirsa’s open support for gangsters today proves that the BJP is backing criminals even through central jails.” After meeting the family of Sanjay Verma on Monday, Arora had stated that gangsters lodged in jails outside Punjab were behind such heinous criminal activities. Whereas, Union Minister of State Ravneet Singh Bittu held the Mann government responsible for the ‘growing fear and lawlessness’ across Punjab. “Instead of owning up to their failure, AAP leaders are shamelessly pointing fingers at the Centre. This is not governance –it’s a complete abdication of duty,” he added. Bittu called Arora’s remarks “irresponsible” and “highly condemnable,” accusing him of trying to deflect attention from the AAP government’s failure to maintain law and order in the state. In a statement released on Monday, Bittu announced that he would write to the Governor of Punjab, urging him to take cognisance of Arora’s “baseless allegations”. He also sought written clarifications from Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav and Chief Secretary KAP Sinha, questioning whether Arora’s statement reflected the official position of the Bhagwant Mann-led government. “Aman Arora’s claim that gangster Lawrence Bishnoi is safe in Gujarat under the Centre’s protection is nothing but an excuse to hide the AAP government’s incompetence. These kinds of inflammatory and misleading remarks are both dangerous and unacceptable,” said Bittu. He reaffirmed that the central government has always taken a tough stance against terrorism and organised crime. “We conducted surgical strikes inside Pakistan when needed. Do you think gangsters are beyond our reach? Once the BJP forms government in Punjab, we’ll show what decisive action really looks like,” Bittu said. Pointing to the killing of Sanjay Verma, Bittu accused the Punjab government of completely surrendering to the gangster nexus. “Extortion threats and targeted killings have become the new normal for Punjab’s business community,” he said. Adding to the political slugfest, AAP’s Abohar constituency in-charge Arun Narang displayed a photo showing Abohar MLA Sandeep Jakhar with Shakti, a bike driver allegedly linked to the murder. Sandeep Jakhar, who is a suspended Congress MLA and nephew of Punjab BJP chief Sunil Jakhar, clarified that the picture was from the 2022 assembly election campaign. “Many people get pictures taken with us during campaigns. It’s illogical to link that picture to this crime,” he said. ‘We have full trust’ Jagat Verma, elder brother of Sanjay Verma, has expressed satisfaction over the police probe. In a video, Jagat Verma said, “We have full trust in the Punjab Police and we are satisfied with the ongoing police investigation. We humbly appeal to one and all to please stop doing politics over this issue. We appeal to the police to nab the rest of the culprits soon… We trust that we will get justice soon.” State of probe The police said their investigations have revealed that the getaway bike was driven by one Shakti, a daily wager from Azimgarh village of Abohar. While escaping, the attackers lost control of their bike and forcibly snatched another two-wheeler. They later abandoned it on Seeto Road and allegedly fled in a waiting Swift car, driven by Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan. Jaspreet Singh’s family has denied any involvement, alleging that he was picked up from his house in Mardankheri village of Patiala during the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday, and that they later received news of his death. They maintain that Jaspreet was a daily wager with no criminal background. The police said Jaspreet had a criminal background, and released a few pictures of him brandishing weapons. The details of his criminal record haven’t been revealed as of now. At the time of filing this report, the postmortem examination of Jaspreet and Ram was underway at the Abohar Civil Hospital under strict police cover. Meanwhile, gangster Aarzoo Bishnoi had claimed responsibility for the murder on social media, tagging Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar and Maharashtra’s Shivam Lonker hours after the murder. After the alleged encounter, Bishnoi again posted that the real shooters remained at large, and that Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan had no role in the killing. The Punjab unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has identified the Lawrence Bishnoi gang as the perpetrators behind this crime. The police, however, have not confirmed these claims nor provided clarity on the identities of the actual shooters.",e5f95abfc958db5d8cdbca385844d557be4c91c691308cd7d60da76720ec2964,110f9aeaaf40f7b999bac5a862114640

Their online conversations quickly grew into what seemed like a genuine relationship, and soon, talks of marriage followed. But the connection, which appeared to promise a shared future, turned out to be an elaborate cyber scam in which he was allegedly duped of a staggering Rs 1.55 crore over eight months. The investigation revealed that the cybercriminals, operating behind the profile of ‘Anamika,’ gradually gained the complainant’s trust and allegedly requested large sums of money. On the pretence of building a future together, ‘Anamika’ allegedly convinced him to transfer funds to purchase a house without ever having met. Over time, the scammers further manipulated him into investing in various trading apps, luring him with promises of exceptionally high returns, said the police. After spending nearly all his life savings and facing further demands for more money, he realised he had been deceived. When he tried to recover his funds, ‘Anamika’ allegedly abruptly stopped all communication with him. The police filed an FIR in March based on his complaint. The investigation by the cybercrime police station in Pimpri Chinchwad unearthed an elaborate network of mule account handlers allegedly operating from Solapur and with links to cybercriminals masterminding these scams from China. The police zeroed in on one particular mule account registered in Solapur in June. As the account holder was questioned, he spilled the beans on three others from Solapur who had allegedly told him that his bank account would be used for taking funds obtained from gaming applications. As the investigation dug deeper into these three suspects, the police established their identities and roles in the racket. The mule account handlers from Solapur have been identified as Shubham Chandrakant Mantha, 25, a resident of Ashok Chowk; Swapnil Chandulal Baheti, 35, a resident of Hotgi Road; and Prashik Uttam Navghare, 26, a resident of Juna Kumbhani Naka. “Our investigation revealed that Mantha worked for a China-headquartered payment application company, and he and Baheti were in direct contact with the masterminds based out of China. A coordinated search operation was launched for the trio as their roles were confirmed in the probe,” an officer who was part of the probe said. In the second week of June, Mantha and Navghare were arrested from Pune International Airport when they were about to flee to Nepal via Patna. Baheti, too, was placed under arrest. “Investigation revealed an elaborate mule handling and fund siphoning operation with direct links to China,” said an officer. All three suspects are currently in judicial custody.

He was stabbed multiple times in the chest and abdomen with a knife, and then left critically injured on the roadside. The assailants fled the scene immediately after the attack. Soon after, a crowd gathered at the spot, and the PCR was informed.

The Chandigarh Police have apprehended two minors in connection with the crime. “An FIR has been registered, and the two juveniles have been booked for murder. They will be sent to a juvenile home,” said Vijay Singh, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Chandigarh Police. Sources revealed that the accused allegedly attacked Sanjeev because he was reportedly stalking their sister. The police have not ruled out the involvement of more individuals and are continuing their investigation. Meanwhile, the preliminary postmortem report has stated that the victim died due to punctured vital organs caused by the stabbings. The incident has triggered tension in the area, with residents demanding increased police patrolling and swift justice.

But when public figures cross legal lines, the consequences unfold not just in courtrooms but also under the relentless scrutiny of the public eye. One name that recently forced this uncomfortable truth into the spotlight is Sean “Diddy” Combs, the hip-hop mogul and music industry titan who, after years of whispers and lawsuits, has now been convicted in a federal court. In July 2025, a jury found Combs guilty on two felony counts of transportation to engage in prostitution under the Mann Act, a law dating back to 1910. These charges relate to the coerced travel of his former partner, singer Cassie Ventura, and another woman identified only as “Jane,” both of whom testified during the trial. Combs was acquitted on three other charges, including racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking. Still, the guilty verdict marks a seismic fall for the 55-year-old artist once synonymous with glamour, success, and cultural dominance. Diddy’s story is far from unique. Over the years, several A-listers have been convicted of crimes — from drug possession and assault to manslaughter and tax evasion. This listicle delves into 10 high-profile celebrities with criminal records, focusing only on those with confirmed legal outcomes. Once a towering figure in global music, Diddy’s legacy has been rocked by criminal convictions. In a 2025 federal trial, he was found guilty of two counts of transporting women – including ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura – for prostitution, under the Mann Act. Though acquitted of more serious charges like racketeering and sex trafficking, the felony convictions carry serious legal and reputational consequences. More fallout may follow. Attorney Tony Buzbee claims over 100 men and women have accused Diddy of rape and assault. One woman alleged she was gang raped at age 17 after being drugged at a 2003 party. While Combs’s team dismisses the lawsuits as publicity stunts, the convictions have added weight to the mounting allegations. Sanjay Dutt’s conviction remains one of the most talked-about legal sagas in Indian cinema. In 1993, following the devastating Mumbai bomb blasts, Dutt was arrested under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) for illegally possessing an AK-56 rifle, which was part of a consignment linked to the bombings. Though he was acquitted of terrorism charges, he was convicted in 2006 under the Arms Act for illegal possession of firearms. After years of legal proceedings and appeals, Dutt was sentenced to five years in prison and ultimately served over four years, including time at Yerwada Central Jail. Before becoming Tony Stark, Robert Downey Jr. was one of Hollywood’s most tragic cautionary tales. Struggling with addiction in the 90s, Downey was repeatedly arrested for possession of heroin, cocaine, and unlicensed firearms. He was famously found wandering into a neighbour’s house under the influence and passed out in their bed. In 1999, after multiple probation violations, he was sentenced to three years in prison, though he served roughly a year before early release. In 2009, Bollywood actor Shiney Ahuja was arrested for raping his domestic help—a case that sent shockwaves through the film industry. Though the victim later recanted her statement, the court found the original testimony credible and convicted Ahuja in 2011 under Section 376 (rape) and other charges. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, though he spent about three years in jail before being released on bail pending appeal. Wesley Snipes’ high-flying Hollywood career hit a wall when he was convicted in 2008 on three misdemeanor counts of failing to file federal income tax returns. Prosecutors claimed he hadn’t paid taxes for years, despite earning tens of millions. Though he was acquitted of the more severe felony tax fraud charges, he still served nearly three years in prison. In 1992, boxing champion Mike Tyson was convicted of raping 18-year-old Desiree Washington, a beauty pageant contestant, in an incident that took place at a hotel in Indianapolis in July 1991. The jury found Tyson guilty after about 10 hours of deliberation, rejecting his defense that the encounter was consensual. Tyson was sentenced to six years in prison and served approximately three years before being released on parole in 1995. The conviction shocked the sports world and dramatically altered Tyson’s public image overnight, marking a significant turning point in his career. Despite this setback, Tyson later returned to the boxing ring and expanded his career into entertainment, including notable acting roles such as in The Hangover film series. In 2001, Stranger Things star Winona Ryder was arrested for shoplifting over $5,500 worth of merchandise from a Beverly Hills Saks Fifth Avenue store. She was later convicted of felony grand theft and vandalism, receiving three years’ probation, 480 hours of community service, and fines. The incident damaged her career for years, leading to a hiatus from leading roles in Hollywood. Ryder eventually made a well-received comeback, and her 2000s-era troubles are now often seen as part of the conversation around mental health and celebrity pressure. Shia LaBeouf is known for his acting talent as well as his history of erratic behaviour and legal troubles. Over the years, he has been arrested multiple times for offenses such as disorderly conduct, public intoxication, and drunk driving. One of the most notable incidents occurred in 2017, when LaBeouf was arrested in Savannah, Georgia, for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. During this arrest, he was caught on camera making a racially charged outburst toward police officers. These incidents, along with other arrests for similar behavior, have contributed to his reputation for instability. LaBeouf has also faced civil lawsuits from former partners, most prominently from singer FKA Twigs, who accused him of sexual battery and emotional abuse. While he has not been criminally convicted in these civil cases, the combination of his legal issues and public controversies has overshadowed his career achievements, leading many to view him as a cautionary example of wasted potential in Hollywood. Before becoming a blockbuster actor and producer, Mark Wahlberg had a violent and troubling past. At 16, Wahlberg was charged with attempted murder after assaulting two Vietnamese men during a racially motivated attack. He was convicted of assault and served 45 days in prison. The case drew renewed attention in 2014 when Wahlberg applied for a pardon, sparking criticism from civil rights groups and raising questions about accountability and privilege. Wahlberg has publicly acknowledged his past and expressed remorse, though his request for a pardon was ultimately dropped. Phil Spector, the music genius behind the Wall of Sound, became infamous for a far more sinister reason. In 2009, he was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2003 death of actress Lana Clarkson, who was found shot in his mansion. The trial, his second, after a hung jury, ended in a conviction and a 19-years-to-life prison sentence. Spector died in custody in 2021.",73697cd66a0be055d4dc8648c5cf018f30e228abbd24ff6c1604b1ab6fa4aac5,1676ed0148c17932b20d45559413e540

The doctor received two bullet injuries, and his condition is critical, they said. Ajay Gandhi, Senior Superintendent of Police, Moga, said Dr Aniljit Kamboj, who is in his fifties, was shot at by two men who came to his Harbans Nursing Home at around 2 pm. “The doctor was treating one of them, and discussing medicines when the second man who was standing behind opened fire. Two bullets hit the doctor, including one in the chest. He has been admitted to a private hospital in Moga, and his condition is critical. He is on ventilator,” Gandhi told The Indian Express. He said the police are probing the case from all angles, and checking CCTV footage to identify the suspects. A family member told The Indian Express that Kamboj had received extortion calls from Canada-based designated terrorist Lakhbir Singh Landa, an operative of the banned organization Babbar Khalsa International (BKI). The threat calls were being received since 2022 and the caller was demanding at least Rs 1 crore, said the family member, requesting anonymity. He further said that Kamboj was also given a security cover by the Moga Police but the lone gunman was withdrawn some months ago. Moga SP (investigation) Bal Krishan Singla, said: “An FIR was registered in 2022 after Dr Kamboj had received threat calls. Landa was nominated as an accused in that FIR.

The deceased have been identified as dhaba owner Siddarodh Tugudi, 35, his nephew Jagadish Belamagi, 28, and employee Ramanna Bhosga, 40. The police said that the triple murders were in retaliation to a killing that occurred in November last year in connection with a feud between two families who belong to the same village. According to the police, Tugudi and his brothers had murdered a criminal identified as Somu Talikoti over a financial dispute and were released on bail recently. To avenge Talikot’s death, four of his brothers along with associates reportedly orchestrated Wednesday’s attack, the police said. “The police have been warning the families after the murder that took place last year. They belong to the same caste and are relatives. We suspect that these murders were carried out in revenge,” said Kalaburagi City Police Commissioner Sharanappa S D on Thursday. The assailants allegedly stormed the dhaba at 12.45 am, targeting Siddarodh and Jagadish, the police said, adding that they have recovered crucial CCTV footage from a nearby petrol station. The accused had damaged the CCTVs installed at the dhaba. “When the dhaba employees attempted to flee through the back door toward an agricultural field, the attackers pursued them.

The accused were riding a motorcycle with a temporary number plate when they were intercepted by the police. Police said that the arrests are linked to the firing incident that took place on the intervening night of June 20-21.

The accused — Sandeep Jawahar Shah, a resident of Solapur, and Salim Khubbuddin Patel, a resident of Navi Mumbai — were arrested in Mumbai and Sangli earlier this month. As per the CBI, it discovered that the two were involved in duping NEET candidates and their parents by falsely claiming to have connections with officials of the National Testing Agency (NTA) that conducts the examination. As per the CBI, Shah initially demanded Rs 90 lakh from each candidate and agreed to accept Rs 87.5 lakh per candidate. The central agency claimed that Shah and Patel would assure candidates that they would receive details of their purportedly increased marks six hours before the official declaration of results. The accused sought to be released on bail on the grounds that probe was completed and their custodial interrogation was not required. The pleas claimed that there was no recovery at the instance of the applicants and they’ll co-operate with the trial after being released on bail. The CBI, however, opposed the pleas stating that the same be rejected as there other accused persons are yet to be arrested and therefore the custodial interrogation of present applicants would be required. However, special judge VP Desai observed that till date (on June 21) “the investigating officer has nothing concrete to show that till what period the other accused will be arrested”. Merely because the other accused persons are yet to be arrested cannot be a ground for rejection of the bail, the judge added. The court further noted that offence under section 7(A) of Prevention of the Corruption (PC) Act is not punishable in imprisonment of life or death and punishment prescribed is not less than three years but will extend to seven years. “Nothing is brought on record against the applicant that he will not be available for trial. Hence discretion in the nature of bail can be exercised in the favour of applicants,” the court held and granted bail to the two on furnishing personal bond of Rs 50,000 each along with other terms and conditions.",4974f52e05170329fc61b34918e72435efd9c5cfb80bb908d716d1ecea37e141,772d6209c825a13e8bd82758db7362e1

NCRB 2015; PhD Scholar,murder,India; AI; Dalit; the United States; Chicago,the 18th century; working hours; 2019; the 1980s; 2018; 2022,,,,,,,"How AI in criminal justice could spark a human rights crisis for the marginalised Written by Roshan Pandey and Chetna Trivedi We are living in the era commonly referred to as Industry 4.0, where artificial intelligence and information technology are becoming part of almost every aspect of life. From education and healthcare to agriculture and criminal justice, governments around the world, including India, are using AI-based technologies with the claim of improving governance, efficiency and transparency. The purpose of technology, ideally, is to improve human life. But an important question remains: Who controls this technology? History reminds us that technological advancement does not automatically translate into better socio-economic conditions. For instance, when the steam engine was invented in the 18th century, it sparked a massive increase in industrial productivity. Logically, this should have reduced working hours and given people more leisure time. On the contrary, working conditions for labourers worsened. This contradiction occurred because the benefits of technology are controlled by the corporate class, who use it to extract labour without improving the workers’ well-being. The same pattern could repeat itself with AI, if we fail to examine “who” shapes and benefits from its development. AI and society: Shaped by bias AI in its current form reflects existing social biases — caste, gender, religion, skin colour, language, and region. A 2019 Guardian report found women are 47 per cent more likely to be seriously injured and 17 per cent more likely to die in car crashes, as cars and their safety systems are designed for male bodies. Sociologists Donald MacKenzie and Judy Wajcman introduced the concept of the “social shaping of technology (SST)” in the 1980s. The SST argues that technology is not neutral. It is influenced by the social, political, and economic environments in which it is developed. A 2018 MIT study found facial recognition systems had a 0.8 per cent error rate for White men, but 34.7 per cent for dark-skinned women. UN Women warns AI can amplify stereotypes across areas like hiring and healthcare. Studies show AI is not neutral and biased data harms marginalised groups. In criminal justice, this could trigger serious human rights issues. Who represents India’s database? In India, there is no specific legal framework to regulate the use of AI. Yet tools are being widely adopted by both government and private institutions. Large language models and generative AI systems operate on existing datasets, but these datasets themselves are shaped by unequal access. The CSDS 2019 report pointed out a deep digital divide in India. A significant part of the population, especially women, Dalits, Adivasis, minorities, and rural communities — has limited or no access to the Internet. Oxfam’s India Inequality Report 2022 found that women use the Internet 33 per cent less than men. Only 31 per cent of rural Indians are online, compared to 67 per cent in urban areas. The situation is even more skewed when it comes to caste, with “upper” caste people having far more representation in digital spaces than Dalits and Adivasis. This means that the data on which AI systems in India are trained does not fairly represent the country’s social reality. As a result, AI tools built on such biased datasets risk reinforcing existing inequalities. AI in criminal justice: A threat to the marginalised? The NCRB’s Prison Statistics 2018 reveals deep inequalities in India’s justice system: Two-thirds of prisoners are Dalits, Adivasis, or OBCs, 19 per cent are Muslim, and 66 per cent are illiterate or have not studied beyond class X. NCRB 2015 data shows over 55 per cent of undertrials come from Dalit, Adivasi, or Muslim backgrounds. This raises concerns about using AI in criminal justice, as biased data can reinforce existing discrimination. Recent examples highlight these risks. The Punjab and Haryana High Court used ChatGPT in a bail rejection for a murder case, setting a troubling precedent. Amazon’s 2014 AI hiring tool, scrapped for bias against women, shows how AI can replicate past injustices. In India, where power in government, corporates, and media is concentrated among the privileged, AI in recruitment and policing without ethical safeguards could further marginalise vulnerable communities. Experts often argue that developed countries possess more advanced AI systems to control crime, whereas developing nations lack the tangible and human resources needed to use such technologies effectively. However, even in the United States, AI-driven systems have demonstrated significant flaws. For instance, the COMPAS algorithm used in the criminal justice system has been shown to be twice as likely to assign higher risk scores to Black defendants compared to White defendants charged with similar offenses. Similarly, the NAACP has raised concerns on the Chicago crime prediction algorithm and its inherent systemic bias against Black communities. These examples highlight the misuse of AI-based technologies that disproportionately affect marginalised groups and violate their human rights. The central government in India is increasingly deploying tech-based tools in the criminal justice system. Notable initiatives include the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS), a nationwide database of crimes and offenders; the Inter-operable Criminal Justice System (ICJS), which enables information sharing among various state institutions; and the National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS), designed to assist in identifying suspects and missing persons. However, the use of such systems in the absence of a well-defined legal and regulatory framework raises concerns. These measures may reinforce systemic bias and lead to further marginalisation of communities that already lack adequate representation and voice within institutional records. The need for inclusive and ethical technology India holds enormous diversity but also deep inequalities. The databases currently used in AI development do not reflect the complexities of Indian society. While AI has many exciting possibilities, it also raises serious ethical and social questions that must be addressed before it is adopted widely. Therefore, the government must enact regulations to ensure AI remains inclusive, transparent, and accountable. Technology must not reinforce existing stigmas and exclusion and rather become a tool for empowerment. AI’s development should be centred around the needs of the marginalised communities to ensure equitable progress.

Miss, he said, after the woman — assuming it was a phone number from a love struck businessman — dropped the note unread into her purse. You’d better look at that note. I have a bomb. For good measure, he opened the briefcase to show her several red cylinders, connected by a wire.Cooper wanted $US200,000 ($305,910), an amount equal to $US1,591,781 ($2,434,697) in today's currency.He wanted it in a knapsack by 5pm. He also wanted two sets of parachutes — implying he intended to take a hostage.The plane would land at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and there the money would be brought aboard, Cooper told the flight crew.Then, and only then, would the 35 passengers be free to go.A leap from a plane launches a decades-long FBI manhuntUltimately the plane circled Seattle for two hours — during that time, many passengers later told media they didn’t even know what was going on.Richard Simmons, head of a prisoner-rehabilitation program, told reporters he slept most of the time we were up there . I saw one stewardess answer a call and her face dropped, he said. She looked bewildered and gulped. I guess she learned what was happening then. His wife, Barbara, worried they may have gotten on the wrong plane. First we went right past Seattle, then Everett, she said. All I could think of was the plane was going to Vancouver and we were on the wrong flight. On the ground, the FBI and the Seattle Police Department rushed to get the money, parachutes, and emergency personnel ready for the landing.The plane landed at 5.46pm, and the money was handed over by an airport staffer — 10,000 unmarked $20 bills in a cloth bag.The passengers got off. The flight attendants retrieved the parachutes. He told them he didn’t need the instructions on how to use them.The plane took off again a few hours later with only Cooper and the flight crew aboard, followed by three fighter jets.This time it was heading for Mexico City, but the hijacker would not make it that far.The black tie DB Cooper left behind on the plane he hijacked. (Supplied: FBI)As the plane travelled somewhere between Seattle and Reno around 8pm, Cooper ordered the flight attendants to open the staircase at the back of the plane.Then he tied the bag of money around his waist, donned his parachutes, and jumped.It was the end of the hijacking, but only the beginning of an investigation that would continue for decades.Suspects, interviews and a $30,000 hoax The new files released this month are the latest in a series to be declassified under the Trump administration.The first lot of more than 400 pages were published online in March.Bundles of crumbling $20 bills from DB Cooper's ransom money were unearthed by a small boy on a sandbar in the Columbia River in 1980. (Supplied: FBI)The documents, at times heavily redacted, outline leads and suspects pursued by the FBI over the years.At one point, a man in a wheelchair became their key suspect, only to be ruled out. It is believed that the hijacker in this case has full use of all of his extremities and witnesses did not tell of any physical disability, the agent wrote. A man confined to a wheel chair [sic] did not hijack the plane in this case. Other men investigated included former pilots and members of multiple different skydiving clubs who bore a resemblance to Cooper.Men who did not resemble the artist’s sketch but who had mentioned different ways to hijack an airplane or suggested the way to hijack [and] escape would be … using a parachute were also reported to police.Several documents include long and redacted lists of suspects whose photographs were shown to witnesses without success.A contributing editor for Newsweek magazine, Karl Fleming, told the FBI he had placed an ad in multiple newspapers asking DB Cooper to contact him.Heists that shocked the worldThe plane hijacking by DB Cooper is just one of a series of high-profile robberies which have hit the headlines around the world.The ad included his home phone number.He said he had been contacted and met multiple times with a man who identified himself as Cooper.At one point, he said he had been shown several $20 bills he said he was 98 per cent positive matched copies of the ransom money shown to him by an unknown source.He handed over $US30,000 ($45,810) for the exclusive interview, publishing a three-part series detailing Cooper’s side of the story.Two men were later convicted and sentenced to serve time in federal prison for impersonating Cooper and pocketing the money.The rest of the files do not draw any definitive conclusion.'DB Cooper, Where Are You?' In the years since the hijacking, the story has become part of American pop culture history.By 1972, T-shirts bearing the phrase DB Cooper, Where Are You? were already appearing in novelty shops across the west coast.A magazine cover featuring DB Cooper published in 1976, included in National Archives files. (National Archives)There have been dozens of fiction and non-fiction books about the case, as well as references in film and television.In David Lynch’s 1990 TV series Twin Peaks, the main character is named Dale Bartholomew Cooper — a nod to the now infamous hijacker.More recently, DB Cooper was revealed to be Loki in the Disney+ series Loki, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.An annual CooperCon convention is held in Seattle, letting Cooper enthusiasts and researchers swap theories.None of it has led to any answers.Max Shaffer, then chief of security for the Seattle region of the Federal Aviation Administration, told the New York Times in 1972 he believed Cooper was dead. I feel that one of these days some hunter in Oregon or Washington is going to find the skeleton of this man, he said.As of July 12, 2016, the FBI had officially ended their investigation, leaving it as one of the longest cold cases in the agency’s history. The mystery surrounding the hijacking of a Northwest Orient Airlines flight in 1971 by a still-unknown individual resulted in significant international attention and a decades-long manhunt, they said in a statement. Evidence obtained during the course of the investigation will now be preserved for historical purposes at FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC.

(Facebook)Their intelligence on Mr Ayik came after he was unwittingly recruited into spreading a police-bugged app, called AN0M, into the underworld by the AFP.The joint AFP and FBI operation involved planting the devices into the hands of criminals and watching on as they used it to organise murders, drug shipments and beatings in Australia and abroad.No AN0M cases against anyone charged in Australia have ever revealed what, if any, link they had to Mr Ayik, deepening the mystery of who one senior law enforcement source described as a Mr Big of the underworld .But a trove of court documents from the United States, released in recent months, reveal his alleged role in luring his mates into the police trap.The man behind the 'Oscar' monikerAs part of their investigation the AFP revealed how rival bikies and crime families would work together using AN0M to supply drugs all over Australia.In court documents from related AN0M cases in the United States, prosecutors described Mr Ayik as an influencer — a role that proved a profitable side hustle.In one filing referring to Mr Ayik under his AN0M username Oscar , one of his associates described how all the profits from the sale of 100 devices would go straight to him.Alleged Australian drug lord Hakan Ayik poses in a Facebook profile photo. (Facebook)That transaction would earn him $75,000 in Bitcoin, according to court documents.The same underling, the documents said, would go on to discuss in messages on the device how Mr Ayik and the crew could start a VIP service for certain AN0M customers.Others paint the picture of Mr Ayik as being the go-to person for AN0M, who would go on to sell more than 12,000 devices as well as allegedly leading the Comanchero from overseas.The Comanchero are one of the most powerful bikie gangs in Australia, who suffered a power struggle during Sydney's recent gangland war.What the AN0M device looked like, before it was revealed to be a police Trojan horse app. (Supplied: AFP)In another court document from the United States, an underling asks Mr Ayik: Touching base with you in relation to AN0M device we prepared for client Tiger? Another describes how Mr Ayik is alleged to have sent clients to those under him and how those clients paid cash through a family member of Mr Ayik.When news of the AN0M operation first broke, rumours from underworld and police sources purported Mr Ayik had fled for his safety to either Syria or Iraq.Two years later in 2023, 46-year-old Mr Ayik would be apprehended shirtless by Turkish police in a posh apartment belonging to him in the heart of Istanbul.Hakan Ayik, during his now infamous capture in Istanbul in 2023. (Reuters: Turkish Interior Ministry/Handout )Charges with a 262-year jail termMr Ayik lived a life of luxury while on the run in Türkiye, though the alleged drug kingpin will likely never face justice down under.Among the lavish hotels, cars and businesses in Istanbul, Mr Ayik was far from going to ground while wanted for a raft of serious drug offences across the globe.Vast swathes of his wealth have now been seized by Turkish authorities who are prosecuting him for a series of alleged drug crimes and money laundering offences.If convicted he faces 262 years in prison.Mr Ayik was rumoured to be a billion-dollar bikie while posting flashy social media snaps on the run and estimates of his wealth ranged from $250 million to as high as $1 billion.The former Sydney bikie is also wanted on a racketeering indictment in the US and appears on watch lists for police authorities from Europe to Australia.Hotels fit for a kingThe Kings Cross Hotel in Istanbul, owned by alleged Sydney crime boss Hakan Ayik.

(Supplied: Supreme Court of Western Australia)Instead, the pellets hit and killed Ralph Matthews Cox, who did not know Nguyen-Ha and had no involvement in the drug world.The jury deliberated for two days before finding Nguyen-Ha guilty of one charge of murder, as well as five counts of doing an act likely to endanger life.Final act in series of shootingsDuring his trial, Nguyen-Ha admitted firing the gun twice but claimed he replaced the shotgun shells with pellets filled with rock salt.He told the court it was his alleged accomplice, Matthew Gempton, who fired a third, fatal shot with a different gun.Gempton, a self-described debt collector, already received a reduced sentence for manslaughter over his role in the shooting after agreeing to be a key witness in Nguyen-Ha's trial.He admitted being Nguyen-Ha's driver in the shooting but said it was his accomplice who fired the gun.Police found Ralph Matthews Cox critically injured at a house in Landsdale in January 2022. (ABC News)The intended target of the shooting, Anthony Prior, admitted in court he had bashed Nguyen-Ha and stolen tens of thousands of dollars from him in late 2021, in a set-up which involved fake drugs.That triggered two earlier shootings at homes in Perth's northern suburbs in which Nguyen-Ha, along with Gempton, were targeting Prior.The prosecution maintained that in those shootings Nguyen-Ha was not a mere bystander but was a planner, and that he was indeed the lone gunman in the final Landsdale shooting.On that night, Mr Cox and his partner were asleep in their front bedroom and stirred when they heard someone outside.He said I've been hit , when he was shot, the court heard.Nguyen-Ha will face a sentencing hearing on August 22.

He wasn't anticipating that that man was going to come out the window and run like he did, he said. They've taken evasive action pretty quickly, and obviously we have seen the collision. It certainly wasn't a deliberate course of action as a way to arrest our offender. He said it was not yet clear how many cars were damaged during the pursuit. It wasn't a pursuit for the entirety of what was going on … there were periods were it just being followed by the air wing. There were some computers in the car that were being tracked, he said.

(ABC News: Che Chorley)In short:A teenager has been sentenced for his role in the ambush attacks on three men who were enticed to meetings via social media under the guise of sexual encounters.The 17-year-old did not orchestrate the meetings, but participated and did not attempt to stop it.What's next? The teenager was spared convictions but ordered to participate in family conferencing and placed on a six-month good behaviour bond.abc.net.au/news/teen-sentenced-for-vigilante-ambush-attacks/105511878Link copiedShareShare articleA teenager involved in vigilante attacks on men lured to meet-ups via social media under the guise of sexual encounters, has been spared convictions for his crimes.The now 18-year-old, was sentenced in Adelaide's Youth Court this week for his involvement in two separate ambushes instigated by his lifelong friend .In sentencing, Magistrate Tracee Micallef said the teen's friend had pretended to be an underage girl on social media and had sexualised conversations with a man aged in his 30s, before luring him to meet in person. The victim thought he was meeting to engage in a sexual interaction with what he thought was a young girl, she said.Ms Micallef said the teenager, who was 17 at the time, only became involved in the offending when his friend invited him to the planned meeting with the man in February. The [friend] came to you and said he had organised to meet up with a paedophile, Ms Micallef said. You agreed to go with him without making any further inquiries as to what was planned or what was happening … you clearly knew that a confrontation was likely to occur. 'Humiliating and degrading' act filmedDuring the confrontation, which involved a group of youths, the man was threatened with a machete and blocked from leaving.Ms Micallef said the man was forced to transfer money to one of the other youths' accounts, and told to remove his shirt and kiss the shoes of the group or he would be assaulted.The man initially refused and was punched. As he was in fear, he did what was asked of him and it was filmed — that is the humiliating and degrading act, Ms Micallef said.She said the victim fled and later tried to have the money returned via his bank but stopped the investigation when he received threats that the footage and embarrassing messages would be released to his family and workplace.Ms Micallef said the victim would always have a concern that the video footage of him is still out there in the cloud somewhere .She said the teen had agreed he was equally responsible for the offending despite not being the instigator or the planner .The teenager had pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated robbery, blackmail and engaging in humiliating or degrading filming in relation to that incident, along with aggravated robbery and attempted aggravated robbery in relation to a second incident in April this year.The men were lured to meet with the youths via social media. (AP: Jenny Kane)Ms Micallef said the second incident involved ambushing two men who were lured to a public area, for what they thought would be a sexual experiment, or interaction, with a third male .She said the two men saw someone in the dark , and were asked, but refused, to go back to their house or a school before they were threatened with a machete.A group of youths, including the now-18-year-old, assaulted the men — one of whom was put in a headlock — and tried to take their keys and wallets, but the men escaped and alerted the police.Ms Micallef said the teen was again not involved in the set-up, nor wielding the machete or making threats but was willingly present.She said the teen — who had spent about two weeks in youth detention after his arrest — had a stable home life, was well-behaved at school and had provided multiple glowing character references to the court.The magistrate said the teen had recognised that despite being long-time friends, the youth who organised the meetings was now a negative influence on your behaviour .'Vigilante behaviour is not acceptable'She said the court had been told that aside from his close friend, he did not know the other youths involved and had been dragged into the offending. Whilst I can accept that the first time you joined your childhood friend you may have not been aware of the planned robbery or humiliation or blackmail … but you did participate in it, she said. You did not leave, nor did you try to stop it. Even if you did nothing but stand there, by your presence you made it frightening for the victim and supported the others in that action. I can also accept that to some extent you may have thought that you were dealing with, or somehow punishing someone who was behaving inappropriately, or about to. However, this behaviour cannot be condoned in any way … this type of vigilante behaviour is not acceptable. Ms Micallef diverted the youth to family conferencing for the offences against the first victim and imposed a six-month good behaviour bond for the second incident. She did not impose any convictions.Posted Thu 10 Jul 2025 at 8:05pmThursday 10 Jul 2025 at 8:05pmThu 10 Jul 2025 at 8:05pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesIn Australia’s era of seeking housing abundance NIMBY has become a ‘dirty word’Topic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Housing longread headerPrivate tobacco shop ATMs generate triple normal transactionsTopic:CrimePhoto shows Boxes of cigarettes surrounded by Australian cash.Air India crash families say preliminary report brings little comfortTopic:Air IncidentsPhoto shows Two men sitting alongside two women dressed in shawls in a green-painted sitting roomSmith falls short of half-ton as Australia bats under lights in JamaicaLIVEPhoto shows Australia batter Steve Smith speaks to West Indies wicketkeeper Shai Hope during a Test.Donald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradePhoto shows Donald Trump speaking to the media in the White House Press Room.Popular nowPrivate tobacco shop ATMs generate triple normal transactionsTopic:CrimePhoto shows Boxes of cigarettes surrounded by Australian cash.How the 'manosphere' is fuelling teen misogyny inside Australian schoolsTopic:TeenagersPhoto shows Daniel Principe, dressed in black shirt and pants, standing in the school basketball court at night.YIMBYs vs NIMBYs in the battle for your backyardTopic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Housing longread headerRelated topicsAdelaideCourtsCrimeLaw, Crime and JusticeSASentencingTop StoriesIn Australia’s era of seeking housing abundance NIMBY has become a ‘dirty word’Topic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Housing longread headerPrivate tobacco shop ATMs generate triple normal transactionsTopic:CrimeAir India crash families say preliminary report brings little comfortTopic:Air IncidentsSmith falls short of half-ton as Australia bats under lights in JamaicaTopic:CricketDonald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradeJust In'Forgotten' Hollywood costume designer celebrated in Aussie home townTopic:History13m ago13 minutes agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 11:55pmMultiple wildfires force evacuations at Grand CanyonTopic:Wildfires37m ago37 minutes agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 11:31pmFarmers fight to keep weather station saying it's 'too valuable to lose'Topic:Rural and Remote Communities39m ago39 minutes agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 11:29pmCommission of inquiry to be launched into Queensland CFMEU Topic:Unions51m ago51 minutes agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 11:17pmMore Just InBack to top In Australia’s era of seeking housing abundance NIMBY has become a ‘dirty word’Topic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Housing longread header Private tobacco shop ATMs generate triple normal transactionsTopic:CrimePhoto shows Boxes of cigarettes surrounded by Australian cash.

The remains of Charlie Gander's body were found in a burnt-out car at Bunbartha on Christmas Eve, 2022.Kylie Stott, Dimitri D'Elio and Danny Clarke have pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, murder and arson in a trial painted by the prosecution as a desire for revenge against Charlie for ratting out their associate to the police.The jury was shown photos taken by Victoria Police of the burnt car, which contained the remains of Charlie Gander's body. (Supplied: Supreme Court of Victoria)At the time of the alleged offending, Ms Stott was aged 37, Mr D'Elio 24 and Mr Clarke 38.All three have pleaded not guilty.The 12 jurors have begun deliberating after 30 days of hearings, including about 41 witnesses made up of pathologists, DNA experts, emergency services and police officers. The jury also heard statements read out by the prosecutor from Mr Gander's girlfriend and his father Richard Gander, including final texts between the pair. Police evidence cost teenager 'dearly', says CrownIn his final address, Mr Gibson argued that each of the accused was guilty of the three charges because each of them was part of an agreement, arrangement or understanding with the others to kidnap Charlie Gander, to murder Charlie Gander and to burn the Ford Territory with Charlie Gander's body in it .Mr Gibson told the jury the alleged motive was Mr Gander's cooperation with police investigating a firearms breach by Tyson May, who was a good friend of Ms Stott. Mr Gander was also friends with Mr May and would hang out with him, the court heard.Following a police raid in Shepparton in November 2022, Mr Gander gave a police interview and made a witness statement about Mr May possessing a firearm. The court heard Gander's body contained high levels of ice, which could not be ruled out as a cause of death. (Supplied: Gander family)Mr May was under a firearms prohibition order, Mr Gibson said. A disc with the record of Mr Gander's police interview found its way into the hands of others , Mr Gibson said. It cost him dearly, he said.The court heard a kitchen knife wrapped in a bloodstained tea towel from under a car seat had a mixed DNA profile of four people, including Mr Gander. Forensic pathologist Paul Bedford, who conducted Mr Gander's autopsy, previously told the court extensive fire damage to the body meant the cause of death could not be ascertained.He also told the court toxicology reports had found very high levels of the drug methylamphetamine, commonly known as ice, which may have contributed to Mr Gander's death.Defence arguments Justice Michael Croucher presented a summary of the defence counsel's arguments to the court before the jury began deliberating.Daniel Sala, acting for Ms Stott, has rejected the prosecution's arguments that she was key in orchestrating the acts against Mr Gander and urged the jury to find her not guilty of murder or arson. Paul Kounnas, acting on behalf of Mr D'Elio, has argued Ms Stott and Mr Clarke were the prime movers in the alleged crimes and that Mr D'Elio was dragged along and used as a patsy . Emergency services found the car on fire on a dirt road in Bunbartha in Victoria's north. (Supplied: Supreme Court of Victoria)The court heard Mr D'Elio, who was in a relationship with Ms Stott, did not know Mr Gander or Mr Clarke and had no skin in the game .Christopher Terry, acting on behalf of Mr Clarke, has argued his client did not intend to kill Mr Gander or enter into any agreement to do so. He said there was no evidence of Mr Clarke's hatred towards Mr Gander or proof of an agreement, and that his client had been dragged into a terrible crime .Charges heard togetherJustice Croucher instructed the jury that they must reach a unanimous verdict for each of the accused, who each face three charges. The jury heard they may find the accused guilty of manslaughter as an alternative if they are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the higher charge of murder. Justice Croucher told the jury manslaughter did not require an intent to kill, but there must be an intentional assault that was dangerous and posed serious injury. He also told the jury their task did not include making moral judgements.He noted jurors had been tasked with not one trial but 12 separate decisions, with the three accused facing three charges and the potential for manslaughter. The 12 charges are being heard together for convenience, and the jury must not allow this fact to usurp justice and must consider each charge separately, Justice Croucher said.Posted Thu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:39amThursday 10 Jul 2025 at 9:39amThu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:39am, updated Thu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:41amThursday 10 Jul 2025 at 9:41amThu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:41amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesIn Australia’s era of seeking housing abundance NIMBY has become a ‘dirty word’Topic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Housing longread headerPrivate tobacco shop ATMs generate triple normal transactionsTopic:CrimePhoto shows Boxes of cigarettes surrounded by Australian cash.Air India crash families say preliminary report brings little comfortTopic:Air IncidentsPhoto shows Two men sitting alongside two women dressed in shawls in a green-painted sitting roomSmith falls short of half-ton as Australia bats under lights in JamaicaLIVEPhoto shows Australia batter Steve Smith speaks to West Indies wicketkeeper Shai Hope during a Test.Donald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradePhoto shows Donald Trump speaking to the media in the White House Press Room.Popular nowPrivate tobacco shop ATMs generate triple normal transactionsTopic:CrimePhoto shows Boxes of cigarettes surrounded by Australian cash.How the 'manosphere' is fuelling teen misogyny inside Australian schoolsTopic:TeenagersPhoto shows Daniel Principe, dressed in black shirt and pants, standing in the school basketball court at night.YIMBYs vs NIMBYs in the battle for your backyardTopic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Housing longread headerRelated topicsBunbarthaCourtsCrimeMelbourneSheppartonTop StoriesIn Australia’s era of seeking housing abundance NIMBY has become a ‘dirty word’Topic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Housing longread headerPrivate tobacco shop ATMs generate triple normal transactionsTopic:CrimeAir India crash families say preliminary report brings little comfortTopic:Air IncidentsSmith falls short of half-ton as Australia bats under lights in JamaicaTopic:CricketDonald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradeJust In'Forgotten' Hollywood costume designer celebrated in Aussie home townTopic:History13m ago13 minutes agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 11:55pmMultiple wildfires force evacuations at Grand CanyonTopic:Wildfires37m ago37 minutes agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 11:31pmFarmers fight to keep weather station saying it's 'too valuable to lose'Topic:Rural and Remote Communities39m ago39 minutes agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 11:29pmCommission of inquiry to be launched into Queensland CFMEU Topic:Unions51m ago51 minutes agoSat 12 Jul 2025 at 11:17pmMore Just InBack to top In Australia’s era of seeking housing abundance NIMBY has become a ‘dirty word’Topic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Housing longread header Private tobacco shop ATMs generate triple normal transactionsTopic:CrimePhoto shows Boxes of cigarettes surrounded by Australian cash.

Ms McGuire was reported missing by her family in April last year, and her body was later found in a burnt-out vehicle south-west of Ballarat. Hannah McGuire, 23, was found dead inside a burnt-out vehicle in April last year. (Supplied: GoFundMe)In opening remarks, chief prosecutor Kristie Churchill told the court Ms McGuire's three-year relationship with Mr Young was controlling and turbulent , and included a series of intervention orders.In one instance, Ms Churchill said Mr Young called Ms McGuire 129 times in a single day.The prosecution will argue that Mr Young murdered Ms McGuire at the Sebastopol home they once shared, before putting her body in the footwell of a car, driving her out to a remote location, and setting both on fire. Ms Churchill told the court that autopsy reports concluded Ms McGuire was dead before the fire started. The prosecution said it would argue Mr Young staged Ms McGuire's death to look like a suicide and systematically deleted evidence.The prosecution rejected Lachlan Young's guilty plea to manslaughter. (Instagram)It is alleged Mr Young seized Ms McGuire's phone post murder and sent text messages as Ms McGuire to her mother and himself. I'm sorry mum, I thought this was the right decision. I tried to heal and cope with it all but I'm not ok, read the beginning of one text Mr Young sent from Ms McGuire's phone to her mother.The prosecution will also argue Mr Young transferred thousands of dollars to Ms McGuire's mother and himself and continued to spread a bunch of lies to friends, family, and police in the days after her murder.Floral tributes were left for Hannah McGuire at the site where her remains were found. (AAP: Con Chronis )Charge of murderMr Young's defence, led by Glenn Casement, told the court the 22-year old man made a very serious admission pleading guilty to manslaughter.Mr Casement said although Mr Young made a series of appalling, bad choices in an attempt to obscure what he did, he did not kill Ms McGuire with murderous intent .The Supreme Court will sit in Ballarat for the next five weeks. (ABC News: Julia Bergin)The defence will argue Mr Young's actions were foolish and shameful , but Ms McGuire's death was an unplanned and spontaneous event .Throughout the next five weeks, the court will hear from a number of witnesses, including friends, family, medical experts, and the man who assisted Mr Young to dispose of the car containing Ms McGuire's body. What's next?A jury of 14 was empanelled on Wednesday morning and will be required to make a unanimous decision, beyond reasonable doubt, on whether Mr Young murdered Ms McGuire.There are four key elements they need to satisfy: that Mr Young caused the death of Ms McGuire, that he did so consciously, voluntarily and deliberately, that he intended to kill or cause serious injury, and that there was no lawful justification or excuse for his actions.

The evidence will be alleged that they have come from China into Australia to commit these crimes and then return. Assistant Commissioner Wood said those targeted were some of the most vulnerable in the community, who allegedly lost $3 million. They, I would describe, are very, very vulnerable people, he said. The majority are female and elderly. They underpin the word vulnerability. And that's what makes this scam, this crime, let's not call it a scam, this crime, so serious. They are like piranhas; they are circling around vulnerable people and they are robbing them, at times, of huge amounts of money.

There's no rules with these people; they're predators. When they see an opportunity, when they need to work as a group they will work as a group, he said. It is extremely sad to see how they act, targeting individuals who are vulnerable, who are elderly. They have no chance.

The court heard the attack on March 20, 2024, targeted businesses linked to Ukraine and was planned by agents of Wagner Group, acting on behalf of Russian military intelligence.The warehouse targeted by the trio stored aid and Starlink satellite devices vital for Ukraine's defence against Russia's continuing invasion.The jury found Jakeem Rose, Ugnius Asmena and Nii Mensah guilty of aggravated arson. (AP/Metropolitan Police)CCTV shown to the court showed Rose and Mensah near the warehouse shortly before setting fire to it.The fire caused around 1 million pounds ($2 million) worth of damage. A fourth man, Paul English, 61, was cleared of any wrongdoing.Prosecutors said the attack was orchestrated by Dylan Earl, 21, and Jake Reeves, 23, who had previously pleaded guilty to aggravated arson on behalf of the Wagner Group.Dylan Earl, left and Jake Reeves, right, pleaded guilty to orchestrating the attack on behalf of Wagner. (AP/Metropolitan Police)Earl also became the first person convicted under the National Security Act when he admitted his role in a plot targeting a wine shop and restaurant in London's upmarket Mayfair district, with plans to kidnap the owner, a high-profile critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.Earl exchanged hundreds of messages with an apparent Wagner handler who encouraged him to find links with soccer hooligans, Irish republican militants and high-profile criminal groups.Arson is latest Russia-linked incidentThe arson attack was the latest incident involving allegations of malign activity by Moscow in Britain.Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the London police's Counter Terrorism Command, said both plots involving Earl showed the Russian state projecting activity into the United Kingdom .He said Russia and other states such as Iran had adapted to British authorities' response to hostile activity, with some 20 per cent of counterterrorism police's work coming from foreign states.The warehouse in East London was storing Starlink satellite equipment bound for Ukraine. (AP/Metropolitan Police) We've made the UK a hostile operating environment for those governments but, as a result, they've diversified and are now contacting relatively young people to act on their behalf as proxies in doing their activity, Commander Murphy said.The Kremlin has denied the accusations, and its embassy in London has rejected any part in the warehouse fire, saying the British government repeatedly blames Russia for anything bad that happens in Britain.In March, a group of Bulgarians were convicted of being directed by Wirecard fugitive Jan Marsalek to spy for Russian intelligence.British authorities say that, since the expulsion of Russian spies following the 2018 poisoning of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal, Moscow has had to rely mainly on criminals motivated by financial gain, or those with existing grievances, to carry out activities on its behalf.AP/ReutersPosted Tue 8 Jul 2025 at 3:31pmTuesday 8 Jul 2025 at 3:31pmTue 8 Jul 2025 at 3:31pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesIn Australia’s era of seeking housing abundance NIMBY has become a ‘dirty word’Topic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Housing longread headerPrivate tobacco shop ATMs generate triple normal transactionsTopic:CrimePhoto shows Boxes of cigarettes surrounded by Australian cash.Air India crash families say preliminary report brings little comfortTopic:Air IncidentsPhoto shows Two men sitting alongside two women dressed in shawls in a green-painted sitting roomSmith falls short of half-ton as Australia bats under lights in JamaicaLIVEPhoto shows Australia batter Steve Smith speaks to West Indies wicketkeeper Shai Hope during a Test.Donald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradePhoto shows Donald Trump speaking to the media in the White House Press Room.Related storiesA 'reckless campaign of Russian sabotage' has been uncovered.

Today, the body of former Transport Minister Roman Staravoit was found in his private car with a gunshot wound in the Odintsovo district, the Investigative Committee said in a statement. The main version [considered] is suicide, it added.Russian state media and news agencies said Mr Staravoit shot himself.There were conflicting reports about the timing of his death.Various Russian media cited law enforcement sources as saying a pistol belonging to Mr Starovoit had been found alongside his body in his car.Just hours earlier, a presidential decree announced Mr Starovoit's departure after barely a year in the job, but gave no reason for his dismissal.The statement read: Roman Starovoit was relieved of the post of Minister of Transport. Political analysts and Russian state media speculated after his sacking that he may have been dismissed in connection with an investigation into corruption in the Kursk region, which he was governor of for over five years.In April this year, Mr Starovoit's successor as governor, Alexei Smirnov, was charged with embezzling money earmarked for defence purposes amid accusations that the funds earmarked for border defences had been stolen, leaving Kursk more vulnerable to Ukrainian attack.Roman Starovoit served as the transport minister under Russian President Vladimir Putin. (Reuters: Sputnik/Alexander Kazakov)Ukrainian forces launched a counteroffensive in Kursk last year, three months after Mr Starovoit left his role as governor to become transport minister.Mr Starovoit's firing also came after another weekend of travel chaos at Russian airports following Ukrainian drone attacks.Pressed earlier on Monday by reporters on whether his dismissal meant Mr Putin had lost trust in Mr Starovoit over Kursk, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said a loss of trust is mentioned if there is a loss of trust . There is no such wording in the [Kremlin] decree.

Suarez pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit bank and mail fraud, along with aggravated identity theft. He faces several years in prison, including mandatory-minimum punishment of two years for the ID theft conviction, at his sentencing hearing in September before U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams.Suarez was indicted in 2023 but was living in Panama City, Panama, at the time. In early 2025, he was arrested in Panama and brought to South Florida to face the charges. According to a factual statement filed with his plea agreement, here’s how Suarez carried out the scam during an FBI-led undercover operation:More than 80 fraudulent checksIn March 2022, Suarez told a confidential informant that he had access to the bank account of an elderly person, who was 82 years old at the time. Suarez created and mailed dozens of falsified checks from Panama to South Florida to the victim’s bank with directions to cash them and return half of the money to his account at Bank of America. The ill-gotten proceeds were wired to his Miami-based company, Online Electronics.To carry out the scheme, Suarez’s fraudulent checks contained forged signatures designed to resemble that of the victim’s on a signature card at Truist Bank.“In total, Suarez and his co-conspirators stole $803,146 from [the victim’s] bank account at Truist through the issuance of more than 80 fraudulent checks to numerous different payees, including at least five individuals and various companies,” according to the factual statement signed by the defendant, his lawyer and a prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami.The statement also said the elderly person reviewed the names of the individuals and companies involved in the fraudulent check transactions. The person did not authorize any of them.The case, investigated by the FBI, Secret Service and FDIC’s Office of Inspector General, was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Thor Pogozelski.This story was originally published July 10, 2025 at 11:32 AM.

Police won’t talk By Grethel Aguila and Charles Rabin July 10, 2025 5:40 PM More than a month after a Miami-Dade judge signed an arrest warrant for former NFL star Antonio Brown, saying he tried to shoot someone outside a celebrity boxing event in Little Haiti, the former all pro has not been taken into custody. Miami Police are not saying what they’re doing to bring him back. Jason Getz Jason Getz-USA TODAY Sports A month after being charged with attempted murder, former NFL star Antonio Brown has posted videos on social media flaunting his lavish lifestyle abroad — riding around in expensive cars and sauntering on a yacht overlooking Dubai’s skyscrapers.It’s almost as if Brown, 37, were taunting police. But Miami Police will not say whether they consider Brown on the run — or if they’re working to bring him back to the U.S. to face trial.A Miami-Dade judge signed off on Brown’s arrest warrant a month ago. But police don’t appear to be looking for him and refuse to discuss the case. There’s also no record or court date for Brown in the database of Miami-Dade circuit court records.READ MORE: Antonio Brown charged with attempted murder after shooting at Miami boxing eventIn a video uploaded to X on Thursday, Brown is seen celebrating his birthday in a red Ferrari 812 GTS and hanging out with his young sons on the water. In another, he is smiling at the camera as he films the sun setting on the Dubai skyline.Meanwhile, Miami Police remain tight-lipped about its efforts — and deadlines — to get Brown to return. Yacht day https://t.co/Xgp6fO6cem— AB (@AB84) July 10, 2025 “The process of determining fugitive status and initiating retrieval efforts depends on various factors, including the nature of the charges, jurisdictional protocols, and international cooperation,” police told the Herald. “We cannot provide timelines as every case differs.”READ MORE: Ex-NFL star Antonio Brown is no stranger to police, discipline in his careerAttorney Mauricio Padilla, who practices criminal law in South Florida and Puerto Rico, said it’s unusual for someone with such a serious charge to remain abroad a month after a judge signed an arrest warrant.“They have given him a lot of leeway,” Padilla said. “Usually, celebrity or not, they want you here.”Brown is accused of shooting at Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu, a 41-year-old man who designs and sells jewelry, after a dispute escalated on May 16 outside a Miami boxing event hosted by social media influencer Adin Ross. After the shooting, Brown said on social media that he was attacked by people trying to steal his jewelry. Breaking: Antonio Brown is going to break the internet@AB84 #CTEPN #SteelerLegend pic.twitter.com/ABKGGw507Y— Say Less (@SayLessHQ) May 17, 2025 Brown, who grew up in South Florida, falsely accused Nantambu of stealing $3 million in jewelry from him, according to a lawsuit filed by Nantambu. The jewelry designer spent a month in jail in the United Arab Emirates, documents show, before proving that Brown lied.READ MORE: Antonio Brown’s false accusations put Miami jeweler in Dubai jail for month: lawsuitPeople accused of crimes usually negotiate with authorities to surrender upon their return. Brown had an attorney early on who secured him a $10,000 bond, including house arrest. As of Thursday, it’s unclear if Brown was being represented by an attorney. Another unknown: whether prosecutors will continue to honor the bond agreement in place. Brown could be detained by the FBI or U.S. Marshals if Miami Police or the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office request that the federal agencies issue a warrant for Brown’s return, said Jeffrey Sloman, a Miami criminal defense attorney who served briefly as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. This is usually accomplished through a federal charge brought forward if a person is avoiding prosecution. If a person remains a fugitive, they may not be granted bond to get out of jail, or a judge could be more harsh in their confinement, Sloman said. The attorney said to look no further than his client Ohad Fisherman, who was on his honeymoon in Japan but returned quickly to address the criminal charge against him. Fisherman — who was entangled in one of the cases brought by the state against the Alexander brothers — had a sex crime charge against him dropped on Monday by state prosecutors.READ MORE: Alexander brothers’ friend cleared in sex case — tearful, angry at state prosecutors“It’s in [Brown’s] best interest to come back immediately, so hopefully the judge would give him a reasonable bond so he can fight the charges out of jail,” Sloman said. “It’s very difficult to fight a case in jail. If Mr. Brown continues to avoid prosecution, eventually he will travel somewhere or to some place and he will be arrested.”Padilla told the Herald police likely believe that Brown will return to South Florida because he has property and children in the area. Formally extraditing Brown, he said, would be costly.

Daniel A. Varela dvarela@miamiherald.com “It’s not easy for the FBI to be dragging people from the Middle East,” Padilla said. “There’ll be a point that if this continues, it could manifest into something larger.”Brown should contact an attorney to turn himself in, Padilla said, because a judge could factor in the amount of time he was abroad after the warrant was signed when deciding his bond. “This is a serious crime. This isn’t going to go away,” Padilla said. “...He’s going to have to face these charges.” Grethel Aguila Miami Herald Go to X Email this person Grethel covers courts and the criminal justice system for the Miami Herald.

Residents tackled him near Shenandoah Park after they say he struck 50-year-old jogger Andrew Loretta with a Volkswagen Jetta, then careened into an ice cream truck and several other vehicles before attempting to run away.Jail records show that Fiallos Estupiñan, 36, was hit with multiple charges, including leaving the scene of the crash involving death, leaving the scene of a crash with serious bodily injury, reckless driving and vehicular homicide.

His attorney, Bradley Horenstein, said Fiallos Estupiñan — who has a history of mental health issues — had a psychotic episode that started before the crash.“This unimaginably tragic case is the result of Mr. Fiallos Estupiñan having suffered a psychotic break, which the hospital spent weeks successfully treating with medication,” Horenstein told the Miami Herald Wednesday.According to Horenstein, Fiallos Estupiñan became agitated while handcuffed to a hospital bed and attempted to get up and leave. A Miami police officer stationed at his bedside Tasered Fiallos Estupiñan multiple times to subdue him. When that had little effect, hospital staff gave him ketamine, an anesthetic used for surgery, and Estupinan was intubated for his safety. A psychiatric evaluation conducted at the hospital provided further detail on the severity of Fiallos Estupiñan’s condition. According to the five-page report, he ripped out his IV line, jumped out of bed naked while handcuffed and set off a hospital alarm after throwing himself against a wall vent.Horenstein said doctors continued to sedate him as he was not responding to medications for the psychosis. Further, Fiallos Estupiñan developed pneumonia and a bacterial infection in his lungs, which landed him in critical condition and the Intensive Care Unit. Andres Roberto Fiallo Estupinan, accused of the hit-and-run death of a Shenandoah father out for a jog on June 10, was jailed Tuesday, July 8, 2025. He’s facing a slew of charges. Estupinan family photo For three weeks, Horenstein was unable to speak to his client due to the heavy sedation.At one point, doctors performed a tracheotomy to avoid long-term damage to his vocal cords from prolonged intubation. Horenstein noted the situation was so dire that his client’s mother was granted a humanitarian visa to fly to the U.S. and sit by his bedside.“The hospital and the City of Miami Police Department were very accommodating,” Horenstein said.Fiallos Estupiñan was slowly weaned off the sedatives as the anti-psychotic medication began to take effect; he is now lucid and calm, Horenstein said.Set to be released on conditionsFiallos Estupiñan appeared in Miami-Dade Bond Court on Wednesday before Judge Gisela Cardonne Ely in an orange jumpsuit with a visible cast on his leg. At the hearing, prosecutors said Fiallos Estupiñan was driving 75 miles per hour in a 25-mph residential zone at the time of the crash. They argued he is both a danger to the community and a flight risk.Prosecutors requested Fiallos Estupiñan’s total bond be set at no less than $100,000 and that if released, he be placed on house arrest, be barred from driving and have his passport confiscated.Horenstein pushed back, telling the judge his client is not a danger to himself or others, but made no arguments on the $100,000 bond. He noted that Fiallos Estupiñan had been hospitalized for nearly a month after the crash and is a commercial engineer by profession. His mother and sister were present in the courtroom.The judge set bond at $25,000 for each charge, for a total of $100,000. She also ordered Fiallos Estupiñan to be placed on Level 2 house arrest, meaning he can only leave home for work, church or meetings with his lawyer.Fiallos Estupiñan, who was born in Ecuador and lived in Chile, was also ordered to surrender his passport before being released from jail. Horenstein said the passport was believed to be inside Estupinan’s car, which has been impounded as evidence by the Miami Police Department.Despite that, Judge Cardonne Ely said the passport must be turned over before Estupinan could walk out of jail. Prosecutors asked Horenstein to provide proof the passport was not in his client’s possession. The judge removed the passport confiscation condition after Horenstein said he confirmed with the Miami Police sergeant supervising the case that the passport was in their possession.Witnesses held him downAccording to his arrest affidavit, Fiallos Estupiñan was driving a gray 2012 Volkswagen Passat on June 10 at a “high rate of speed” southbound on Southwest 21st Avenue near 17th Street just before 7 p.m. Police say he had an expired Florida driver’s license.At the same time, Andrew Loretta, 50, was jogging along the west side of 21st Avenue, heading toward 18th Street.Surveillance footage shows Fiallos Estupiñan striking the jogger from behind with such force that Loretta was thrown into the air and both of his legs were severed.After hitting Loretta, Fiallos Estupiñan crashed into a white 2013 Nissan ice cream van that was stopped at 21st Avenue and 18th Street, serving children at Shenandoah Park. Police say Estupinan made no “visible attempt to brake” before the impact.The Volkswagen then struck two more parked vehicles: a gray 2019 Toyota and a white 2023 Mercedes SUV, both on the west side of 21st Avenue near the park.Two witnesses told police that Fiallos Estupiñan immediately got out of the car and ran away without trying to help the injured jogger or calling 911. He ran into Shenandoah Park, where several bystanders stopped him and held him down until officers arrived.Loretta was pronounced dead at the scene. Estupinan had a broken ankle, while a passenger in one of the hit cars had a skull fracture.A beloved community memberIn Miami’s Shenandoah neighborhood, just off Coral Way, the sudden death of Loretta—a married telecommunications executive and father of two teenagers—has left his family heartbroken and the community in shock. Friends and relatives described him as an avid jogger and soccer enthusiast who moved to Miami from California in 2000. He was fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.A GoFundMe page to support Andrew’s family has raised over $193,000 with just over 900 donations.“I hope that justice is served. Not only for Andy, but for the family ... At the end of the day [Andres] has to deal with his own karma. I honestly feel a lot of compassion for him. It’s just a terrible situation,” John Loretta, Andrew’s cousin, who lives in Kendall, said.The Loretta family, including his wife and children, said in a statement through their attorney that they are grateful for the support they have received.“This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the Loretta family, and they remain deeply grateful for the outpouring of support from family, friends, and the community,” Raul Chacon, the family’s attorney, said in a statement to the Miami Herald. “At this point, they will have no further comment on the ongoing legal proceedings. Thank you for respecting their privacy and understanding their need to grieve in peace. “Miami Herald writer Isabel Rivera contributed to this report.This story was originally published July 9, 2025 at 4:17 PM.

Once limited to Southeast Asia, the criminal model is spreading — and uses AI.https://p.dw.com/p/4whWKOnline scam centers were initially concentrated in Cambodia, with additional trafficking hubs later uncovered in Laos and MyanmarImage: Kyodo News/IMAGOAdvertisementHuman trafficking-fueled scam centers have significantly expanded their operations worldwide, according to a crime trend update released on Monday by the international police agency Interpol. Hubs where trafficking victims are forced to take part in online fraud first emerged in a few Southeast Asian nations, but investigators are now also uncovering similar fraud centers in other regions. Where are scam centers spreading? According to the international police organization, victims now come from 66 countries across all continents, highlighting what Interpol describes as a global crisis involving hundreds of thousands of people. Scam centers are now increasingly found in other regions, including the Middle East, West Africa — fast emerging as a new regional hub — and Central America. Victims are often lured with fake job offers and then held captive in scam compounds. Many are blackmailed over alleged debts, beaten, sexually exploited, and in some cases tortured or raped. Inside these centers, they are forced to run online scams, mostly targeting people abroad to steal money.Freed captives describe scam operations in MyanmarTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video A 2024 Interpol-led operation exposed dozens of cases where victims were coerced into committing fraud, including a raid on an industrial-scale scam centre in the Philippines. That same year, police dismantled a centre in Namibia where 88 youths were forced to scam others. Emerging technologies are fuelling this trend further. The crime update notes a surge in the use of artificial intelligence, from generating fake job ads to creating deepfake profiles for sextortion and romance scams. Who are the victims? Interpol says the pool of those preyed upon has widened significantly. While early human trafficking victims were mainly Chinese-speaking and came from China, Malaysia, Thailand or Singapore, people are now being trafficked to such hubs from South America, East Africa and Western Europe. Tackling this rapidly globalizing threat requires a coordinated international response, said said Interpol's acting head of police services Cyril Gout. Who are the people traffickers? The report found that about 90% of human trafficking facilitators came from Asia, while 11% were from South America or Africa. About 80% of these facilitators were men, with 61% aged between 20 and 39. Online scam centers were initially concentrated in Cambodia, with additional trafficking hubs later uncovered in Laos and Myanmar. Today, similar operations have been identified in at least four more Asian countries, and evidence shows the model is spreading to other regions such as West Africa, where cyber-enabled financial crime is already common. In its findings, Interpol warned that the spread of such criminal networks needs urgent, coordinated action to disrupt trafficking routes and support victims. Interpol said that these criminal hubs are increasingly intertwined with other major transnational crimes, demanding a globally coordinated response. Trafficking routes used for scam centers are being exploited for smuggling drugs, firearms, and endangered wildlife like tigers and pangolins, Interpol said.

Here's how the death cap became the center of a chilling murder case. https://p.dw.com/p/4x8P8Even small amounts of death cap mushrooms are lethal if consumed.Image: Hans Reinhard/Okapia/picture-allianceAdvertisementA jury in Australia has found Erin Patterson guilty on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder. The murder weapon: Toxic mushrooms. Prosecutors argued Patterson intentionally served four of her family members with meal portions containing toxic death cap mushrooms in 2023. Patterson denied being guilty, originally telling police she had used store-bought mushrooms from a supermarket, then an Asian grocer in Melbourne. A search of such stores found no evidence that poisonous mushrooms had ever been sold. During the trial, Patterson said she may have foraged for the mushrooms but could not say for certain where she had obtained the death caps. Why are death cap mushrooms so deadly? Deadly by name and by nature, death cap mushrooms (Amanita phalloides) are full of a highly stable toxin called alpha-Amanitin. The toxin is so stable that it won't break down when exposed to heat in cooking. When a death cap is eaten, people don’t usually feel symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea until at least 6 hours later. During this time the alpha-Amanitin toxins are making their way through the bloodstream into organs of the body. The toxin primarily acts in the liver, where it causes cells in the liver to die. Alpha-Amanitin binds with RNA polymerase-II enzymes, preventing the cells from creating new proteins. Eventually, the liver starts to shut down. Death can occur within 24 hours. Careful identification required The Amanita genus of fungi is well-known for their toxic properties. This group include the fairytale toadstool commonly known as the fly agaric, death caps, and destroying angels . But some other Amanita mushrooms are edible. Most cases of death cap poisoning are often a case of misidentification — their classic white appearance and domed cap looks like many other types of fungi. Identification of mushrooms requires a knowledge of different parts of the anatomy: the cap or fruiting body, the gills or spores beneath the cap, and the stipe — or stalk. While death caps look like many other mushrooms, one defining characteristic is their bad smell. They don't store well at all, unless you dehydrate them. They quickly go very stinky and very nasty, Brett Summerell, a fungi expert and Chief Scientist at the Botanic Gardens of Sydney, Australia, told DW. Because of the risk of misidentification by amateurs, it's usually recommended that foragers go for edible species that cannot be mistaken. Of course, foraging under the supervision of a trained mycologist — a fungi scientist — is usually a safe option. The famous red and white toadstool is a member of the Amanita genus, and a cousin of other deadly mushroom species.Image: FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP No death caps in the supermarket The jury ultimately didn’t find Patterson’s defense — that she mixed up foraged mushrooms in the same container as store-bought ones — believable. The prosecution argued Patterson knowingly put the toxic mushrooms in the home-cooked lunch and disposed of evidence. Summerell said the likelihood that death caps could get into store-bought products is, to be honest, farcical. The reason? Death caps only grow next to oak and beech trees. Death caps, like many fungi, are mycorrhizal, meaning they have a symbiotic relationship with the tree species. Death caps obtain their nutrients from nearby tree roots and return nutrients to the nearby soil. But because they can only grow at the base of oak and beech trees, it means there's no chance of them sprouting in a commercial setting, where spores are cultivated in highly controlled conditions — and with no trees in sight. Australia could get rid of death caps Death caps aren’t native to Australia, and neither are the oak and beech trees that support them. The trees were first introduced into Australia from Europe in the 19th ecntury, and death caps in the 1960s. Summerell and other mycologists are now discussing the possibility of removing oak trees in some parts of Australia. We have argued that, in Sydney, if it's at all possible, we should start to think about removing oak trees from some of these suburbs just from the point of view of a public health risk, said Summerell. Removing introduced oaks could harbor positive benefits, both from a public health perspective by removing the risk of the top cause of mushroom poisoning, as well as providing more space for native Australian plant life.

But some criminologists doubt the figures.https://p.dw.com/p/4wuVjShoplifting is on the rise, say retailersImage: Carsten Milbret/imageBROKER/picture allianceAdvertisementGermany has never had more shoplifters than in 2024. An annual survey of 98 retailers estimates a 3% increase on the year before — amounting to some €4.95 billion ($5.84 billion) in losses. The latest study by Germany's Retail Institute (EHI) on inventory differences shows that the vast majority of those losses (€4.2 billion) was down to theft from customers, employees, or delivery workers, the EHI said, which would mean losses of some €570 million to the public purse through lost sales tax. The EHI also said that retailers had to resort to balancing out their losses and the costs of extra security by increasing prices. Study author Frank Horst calculated that some 1.5% of prices in stores could now be attributed to covering theft and security. Shoplifting techniques The EHI said there had also been a 5% increase in organized shoplifting, which accounted for a third of the total shoplifting losses. Horst said this could be individual thieves working their way through a shopping list, or else, the thefts could be carried out by coordinated groups. One of them drives a vehicle, one of them distracts the staff, or shields the one putting the goods away so they can't be seen, Horst told DW. Sometimes so-called depots are set up in the store, where all the goods are packed in a bag, and then someone else carries it out in a surreptitious moment. The survey does not include exact breakdowns of the kinds of articles that get stolen, but Horst says that thieves often target anything small, expensive, and that can be easily re-sold, such as perfume and cosmetics. There had also been a rise in the theft of foods, especially relatively expensive things like meats and cheeses. But Nicole Bögelein, a criminologist at Cologne University, cast doubt on how useful the study actually is. She told DW that the researchers estimate that 98% of cases aren't even discovered. So it's just an assumption that the majority of these losses can be attributed to theft, she said. Bögelein also cast doubt on the EHI's conclusion that there are more organized shoplifting gangs, as that could simply be because store detectives are more on the lookout for such groups. 'Poverty crimes' Despite its shortcomings, the annual EHI survey is one of the few shoplifting studies there are, and it is focused mostly on the economic impact. Bögelein, by training a sociologist as well as a criminologist, has a different perspective and says that almost all cases of shoplifting are so-called poverty crimes — defined as crimes that don't cost any money to carry out, and are committed by people because they have no money. Bögelein's own investigations into shoplifting have found that the people who are caught are often poor — possibly, she says, also because store detectives are more likely to keep an eye on people who look poor. Official statistics suggest that the majority of thefts from shops are relatively petty. According to German federal police statistics, in 66.7% of discovered and prosecuted thefts, the value of the items stolen was under €50 and in 40.2% of cases even under €15. The punishment is usually a small fine, or, if the fine can't or won't be paid, a prison sentence. Germany a 'paradise' for shoplifters? Horst described Germany as a paradise for shoplifters, as the punishments are often relatively mild. Though theoretically thieves can be imprisoned for up to five years, he said that in practice first-time offenders are often not charged at all. Bögelein said that deterrence might have an effect on some minor thefts, but was generally skeptical of the idea that more punishment discourages petty crime. People don't not steal because they're scared of punishment, she argued. In criminology, we find that people stick to rules because they think those rules are correct and because they fear a bad conscience if they don't stick to them. Public transport operators in Germany often charge people a fee for riding without a ticket, but may also press charges, especially for repeat offenders.Image: picture-alliance/dpa/J. Wolf Should shoplifting be decriminalized in Germany? There has been a debate among German criminologists about to what extent poverty crimes should be decriminalized altogether, on the grounds that such crimes are usually victimless and therefore don't require criminal justice. There have long been calls to downgrade one classic poverty crime — riding public transport without a ticket — to a misdemeanor, partly because punishing it has become a burden to public coffers and is clogging up the justice system. Between 8,000 and 9,000 people end up in prison in Germany every year for riding without a ticket. But Horst argued that shoplifting shouldn't always be defined as a poverty crime: The EHI estimates that two-thirds of shoplifting cases were what he called opportunistic perpetrators, and many of them are not necessarily poor. Horst does think that inflation and higher prices for basic items may be playing a role in the rise of shoplifting, but he was reluctant to accept that poverty was the driving element of all theft. It could be a protest theft, because people are saying they're not prepared to accept the price rises for a particular product, he said, I'm sure poverty is a part of it, but that it explains the rise on its own — I don't see that.

But some criminologists doubt the figures.https://p.dw.com/p/4wuVjShoplifting is on the rise, say retailersImage: Carsten Milbret/imageBROKER/picture allianceAdvertisementGermany has never had more shoplifters than in 2024. An annual survey of 98 retailers estimates a 3% increase on the year before — amounting to some €4.95 billion ($5.84 billion) in losses. The latest study by Germany's Retail Institute (EHI) on inventory differences shows that the vast majority of those losses (€4.2 billion) was down to theft from customers, employees, or delivery workers, the EHI said, which would mean losses of some €570 million to the public purse through lost sales tax. The EHI also said that retailers had to resort to balancing out their losses and the costs of extra security by increasing prices. Study author Frank Horst calculated that some 1.5% of prices in stores could now be attributed to covering theft and security. Shoplifting techniques The EHI said there had also been a 5% increase in organized shoplifting, which accounted for a third of the total shoplifting losses. Horst said this could be individual thieves working their way through a shopping list, or else, the thefts could be carried out by coordinated groups. One of them drives a vehicle, one of them distracts the staff, or shields the one putting the goods away so they can't be seen, Horst told DW.

In Nairobi's business district, small groups of protesters gathered on Tuesday, initially peacefully, to call for an end to police brutality. But according to media reports, they were quickly attacked by hundreds of men on motorbikes armed with makeshift weapons, known in Kenya as goons.

One of the officers pointed his gun in the direction of protesters, then ran with a colleague to a vendor named Jonah Kariuki. The officers pushed the man. As he is shoved and is moving away, Kariuki glances back. The officer raises his weapon and shoots 22-year-old Kariuki at close range in the head — who crumples to the sidewalk. After the shooting, the officer and his colleague walk away. Police's reaction to the shooting Police did not directly deny any cooperation with the armed goons, releasing a statement saying it does not condone such unlawful groupings. Police also said the officer who shot Kariuki in the head using an anti-riot shotgun had been arrested. Activists called for the officer to be charged. The judiciary in a statement on Wednesday said it was committed to uphold justice in all cases, including those involving alleged police brutality.

Kenyan government's latest finance bill avoided the tax hikes that sparked weeks of protests in mid-2024. Rights groups say over 60 people were killed and dozens more were illegally detained by security forces in the aftermath. The protests peaked when thousands stormed parliament on June 25, 2024 when lawmakers debated the unpopular finance bill. The bill is now expected to take effect on July 1, 2025. But demonstrations picked up again over the death of 31-year-old teacher and blogger Albert Ojwang, who died in police custody earlier this month. Protesters want a senior officer they blame for the death to resign.

Why is there a market for her content in the Balkan country and how are some Bulgarians fighting it?https://p.dw.com/p/4vrvKOn her social media profiles, Bulgarian influencer Zornitsa Gyutsova posts misogynistic advice about how men should 'deal with' womenImage: Zgyutsova/TikTokAdvertisement Women love men who can be violent if need be. That's why they like men who hit them, Bulgarian influencer Zornitsa Gyutsova tells her followers. Gyutsova suggests that not only do women prefer men who physically assault them, but that this is also the way men should behave because a woman should respect a man's physical power since she is unable to comprehend his intellectual power. This is the kind of advice that can be found on Gyutsova's social media profiles and in a private group founded by her on Telegram called Upstanding Man. 'Equality is contrary to human nature' Zornitsa Gyutsova offers her followers private chats over video where she teaches them how to deal with women — for a fee, of course. Many influencers, life coaches and other online personalities in Bulgaria and elsewhere offer private sessions or courses. What makes Gyutsova's content stand out from the rest is that its sole purpose is to explain to men that they need to learn to control their partners both psychologically and, if necessary, physically.There have been numerous protests against violence against women in Bulgaria in recent years, such as this one in 2023Image: Alexandar Detev/DW In Gyutsova's view, men in general have been treated badly by women, and women are the ones who exert violence on men, namely by not paying them enough respect. The idea of equality is like a worm in people's brains that insists men and women should be partners […] which is so contrary to human nature that it can never work, Gyutsova declared in a long video about her work that was broadcast on Bulgarian National Television. Although the broadcaster, which is partly financed by taxpayer's money, has since removed the video from its platforms, it has never publicly commented on the case. Huge backlash Gyutsova's profiles on social media have been gaining traction for several years now. Screenshots and videos from her private Telegram group chat recently surfaced on social media, triggering a huge backlash in Bulgaria. Local woman Petya Krasteva was so appalled by Gyutsova's online content that she filed a complaint against Gyutsova with the prosecutor's office. On her social media channels, she not only encourages people to degrade women and use violence against them, she also boasts that she uses the same methods on her child and her cat, she told DW. I thought to myself: This is not only absolutely unacceptable, it's criminal. Gender discrimination not a crime in Bulgaria Many other women did the same as Krasteva, only to find out a couple of weeks later that their efforts had been in vain.Petya Krasteva was appalled by Zornitsa Gyutsova's online content and filed a complaint against her with the prosecutor's officeImage: Nikola Gyulmezov In an official reply, the prosecutor's office stated that nothing could be done because Bulgaria's criminal code does not define gender discrimination as a crime and that the issue was a matter for the Commission against Discrimination. Krasteva promptly lodged a complaint with this commission, but received another negative answer based on the same reasoning. Profiles briefly taken down Although these complaints did not lead to charges being brought against Gyutsova, the backlash did have an impact. The outcry and the fact that Gyutsova's social media accounts were reported by people who found their content abhorrent, meant that the influencer's TikTok and Instagram profiles were deactivated. They were, however, reactivated a short time later. Impunity for abusers Krasteva feels that part of the reason why content like Gyutsova's strikes a chord in Bulgaria is that while patriarchal norms and domestic violence are not accepted in the country, Bulgarian society often turns a blind eye to them. The other huge problem, she says, is that as with many other social issues, there is a complete lack of consequences for the perpetrators. Valentina Dimitrova, a psychologist who works for the Emprove Foundation, a Bulgarian organization that supports women who have suffered domestic violence, holds a similar view.Psychologist Valentina Dimitrova says that content like Gyutsova's is dangerous because 'it can truly cost a human life'Image: Venera Velkovska Sadly it's embedded in the Bulgarian mindset that we often just accept that things are bad and we do nothing about it, says Dimitrova. She believes that this is also why many women stay in violent relationships: They simply have no faith in the authorities because time and time again, men who beat or even kill their partners face no legal consequences. Although some people seem to think that social media content is less problematic than actual abuse in real life, Dimitrova stresses the dangers associated with such content: It can truly cost a human life. A global online problem Misogynistic online content that paints women as lesser human beings and men as oppressed by women is not unique to Bulgaria. Such content has been growing and spreading all over the world in recent years. Influencers like Andrew Tate, who faces charges of rape, bodily harm, human trafficking and more, have created a whole movement around this sort of content. Gyutsova fits neatly into this category of influencer, but what makes her different is that she is a woman. What role does feminism play? Dimitrova thinks one issue here is that feminism is often misunderstood. Feminism does not entail men being suppressed and women controlling them. It means that women can have equal rights and can function as equals to men not only in society but also in their personal relationships, she says. Dimitrova also believes that the patriarchal notion that men should not be allowed to express emotions is highly problematic. This is reflected in Gyutsova's content, which suggests that men are weak and not manly if they dare to express their fears, emotions or feelings.People in Sofia attend a protest against domestic violence and violence against women in Bulgaria in 2023 after a young woman was stabbed by her ex-partner Image: Alexandar Detev/DW It's a vicious circle: Men who are not allowed to express any sort of emotion for fear of being labeled weak don't know what to do when they experience something frustrating in their relationships and so they resort to aggression, says Dimitrova. What can be done? Dimitrova suggests that first and foremost, men should receive support and their concerns should not just be swept under the carpet. She stresses, however, that this support should not validate the inclination to deal with problems by exerting psychological or physical violence on women. Although the Emprove Foundation focuses primarily on women's rights and issues, it does have a project that focuses on men's mental health — something the foundation says is incredibly important in the fight against gender-based violence. Men should be encouraged to connect to a healthy understanding of themselves, so they can build healthy relationships as well, says Dimitrova. Petya Krasteva firmly believes that even though authorities in Bulgaria rarely provide the support needed in cases like this, society should not remain indifferent. We should be as loud as possible when something like this turns up, she says. We should be perfectly clear that it is unacceptable. That way, other people who come across this content will know that this is not something that society approves of, and that could help them realize that they shouldn't have anything to do with it. Dimitrova agrees. We will keep talking about it [this kind of content], calling it out and not tolerating it until the authorities wake up.

Why did an Argentinian court ordered an international warrant for her arrest?https://p.dw.com/p/4uJX3Aung San Suu Kyi has been imprisoned by the Myanmar military since 2021 (archive picture from 2012)Image: Loviny Christophe/ABACA/picture alliance AdvertisementIt is rare for an international arrest warrant to be issued against a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and political prisoner whose release is demanded by both the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council. However, this is precisely what occurred in February this year, when an Argentinian court asked for the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi. The court's decision applies to 25 Myanmar citizens wanted on charges linked to genocide and crimes against humanity. The list includes not only Myanmar's military leader Min Aung Hlaing, but also former State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and former President Htin Kyaw. Suu Kyi effectively served as Myanmar's top civilian leader before the military staged a coup in February 2021. She has been imprisoned ever since. The court in Argentina claims it has the jurisdiction to order a warrant for Suu Kyi's arrest based on a legal principle that some serious crimes can be prosecuted regardless of where they were committed. The specific case focuses on discrimination against Myanmar's Rohingya ethnic minority. The Muslim Rohingya live predominantly in the western state of Rakhine, and their status as citizens and as an ethnic group recognized by the state of Myanmar has been disputed for decades. The Rohingya crisis of 2017 Since 1988, Myanmar has seen an ongoing political conflict between the military and military-backed parties on one side and Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, on the other. In 2016, after many years of stalemate, the military and Aung San Suu Kyi reached a truce. A kind of dual government was established, with Aung San Suu Kyi heading the civilian branch and Min Aung Hlaing heading the military, which had constitutionally secured independence and far-reaching political rights. On October 9, 2016, Rohingya insurgents attacked several border and police posts of the Myanmar security forces. In August 2017, the security forces launched so-called clearance operations. As a result, thousands of Rohingya were killed and around 700,000 fled to neighboring Bangladesh, with exact figures still unclear due to the nature of the ethnically-charged conflict. Rohingya refugees fear increased hardship due to aid cutsTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video While the military denied using excessive force, international watchdogs and the UN agree that Myanmar's actions against the Rohingya constitute grave human rights violations. Still, two questions remain: First, did the offensive amount to genocide? Second, how much of it was the responsibility of Aung San Suu Kyi? The question of genocide Concerns that a genocide was happening in Myanmar have already been voiced before 2017. In 2015, the human rights organization Fortify Rights published a report with the Allard K. Lovenstein International Human Rights Clinic from Yale Law School in which was stated that there is strong evidence that genocide is being committed against Rohingya. Those voices only grew louder after 2017, and in November 2019, Gambia initiated a case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Myanmar, claiming violations of the UN's Genocide Convention. The ICJ has yet to rule on the case, however, meaning that the existence of genocide remains unconfirmed in a legal sense. But for human rights organizations like Fortify Rights, the Burmese-Rohingya Organization UK (BROUK) and the former UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar, Tomas Ojea Quintana, there is no doubt that genocide did take place. Quintana, an Argentinian, told Radio Free Asia that the court in his native country understood what was at stake, which is the genocide against the Rohingya people. The question of responsibility Aung San Suu Kyi was a globally renowned human rights advocate since the early 1990s until the events of 2017. She was also heading Myanmar's civilian government during the deadly wave of violence against the Rohingya. As chief councilor, she was notably hesitant to speak out against the military and even went to The Hague in 2019 to defend Myanmar at the International Court of Justice. She denied genocide was happening in Rakhine but admitted human rights violations, which would be investigated by Myanmar. She later confirmed this position in an interview with the Financial Times. War crimes were committed during the internal armed conflict with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army by members of Myanmar's security forces and civilians, she told the paper. At the same time, Aung San Suu Kyi pointed to a report by the Independent Commission of Enquiry (ICOE) which was set up by Myanmar without Rohingya representatives. The ICOE found no evidence of genocide, she told the paper, despite its report recording killing of civilians, disproportionate use of force, looting of property, and destruction of abandoned homes of Muslims. For those who believe Myanmar troops committed genocide against the Rohingya, Aung San Suu Kyi's refusal to recognize it makes her complicit. But does her stance — admitting that human rights violations happened but not genocide — mean Aung San Suu Kyi is guilty of committing genocide? What do we know about the Argentinian court order? The reasons behind the Argentinian court's decision to seek an international arrest warrant are not fully clear, as neither the ruling nor the exact evidence on which the ruling was based are publicly available. DW contacted the Argentinian court and the Argentinian human rights commission to get more information in the matter, but received no reply. The 2021 coup triggered protests in Myanmar, which eventually escalated into a civil war.Image: Sai Aung Main/AFP In the months following the announcement, Myanmar expert and former ambassador Derek Tonkin published an academic paper on the issue, examining the sources which most likely led to the arrest warrant. He writes that the petition [on which the decision of the court seems to be based] contains much narrative and opinion which are debatable and questionable, and in some areas are simply wrong. Commenting on the claim that Aung San Suu Kyi and others validated the genocide against the Rohingya, Tonkin states, it is not true and is supported by no evidence anywhere in the petition. Tonkin also rejects the accusation that Aung San Suu Kyi was directly responsible for the events in Rakhine State during her time as state counsellor at the time. I find this totally unconvincing. The Tatmadaw [the Myanmar military] refused to accept Aung San Suu Kyi's appointment, he writes. So far, the arrest warrant hasn't had any impact. Aung San Suu Kyi seems set to celebrate her 80th birthday next month as a prisoner in Myanmar as the civil war rages on. With the passage of time, the international arrest warrant might end up as a mere footnote in a long political career filled with legal battles.

Sanjay Verma was shot dead on Monday at around 10 am, right outside his showroom in Abohar. According to eyewitnesses, three motorcycle-borne assailants lay in wait for him. The moment Verma stepped out of his car, they opened indiscriminate fire, killing him on the spot before fleeing the scene. While the shooters escaped and have yet to be identified, the Punjab Police announced the arrest of two of their accomplices, Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan, both residents of Patiala district, for helping the shooters escape in the car. However, within hours, both men were killed in a police encounter. This development has added fuel to the controversy. BJP General Secretary Manjinder Singh Sirsa accused the Punjab government of mishandling the law and order situation. On his visit to Chandigarh Wednesday, Sirsa said, “First of all, the Punjab government is not able to control the law and order and criminals… Punjab has become a police state. If Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has a clean image, he should get a CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) inquiry conducted into these encounters so the truth comes out.” Reacting sharply, AAP’s Punjab state president Aman Arora called the BJP’s stance “extremely shameful,” accusing it of siding with gangsters instead of supporting Verma’s bereaved family. Arora said, “While the entire Punjab stands with the family of Shri Sanjay Verma, Manjinder Singh Sirsa’s open support for gangsters today proves that the BJP is backing criminals even through central jails.” After meeting the family of Sanjay Verma on Monday, Arora had stated that gangsters lodged in jails outside Punjab were behind such heinous criminal activities. Whereas, Union Minister of State Ravneet Singh Bittu held the Mann government responsible for the ‘growing fear and lawlessness’ across Punjab. “Instead of owning up to their failure, AAP leaders are shamelessly pointing fingers at the Centre. This is not governance –it’s a complete abdication of duty,” he added. Bittu called Arora’s remarks “irresponsible” and “highly condemnable,” accusing him of trying to deflect attention from the AAP government’s failure to maintain law and order in the state. In a statement released on Monday, Bittu announced that he would write to the Governor of Punjab, urging him to take cognisance of Arora’s “baseless allegations”. He also sought written clarifications from Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav and Chief Secretary KAP Sinha, questioning whether Arora’s statement reflected the official position of the Bhagwant Mann-led government. “Aman Arora’s claim that gangster Lawrence Bishnoi is safe in Gujarat under the Centre’s protection is nothing but an excuse to hide the AAP government’s incompetence. These kinds of inflammatory and misleading remarks are both dangerous and unacceptable,” said Bittu. He reaffirmed that the central government has always taken a tough stance against terrorism and organised crime. “We conducted surgical strikes inside Pakistan when needed. Do you think gangsters are beyond our reach? Once the BJP forms government in Punjab, we’ll show what decisive action really looks like,” Bittu said. Pointing to the killing of Sanjay Verma, Bittu accused the Punjab government of completely surrendering to the gangster nexus. “Extortion threats and targeted killings have become the new normal for Punjab’s business community,” he said. Adding to the political slugfest, AAP’s Abohar constituency in-charge Arun Narang displayed a photo showing Abohar MLA Sandeep Jakhar with Shakti, a bike driver allegedly linked to the murder. Sandeep Jakhar, who is a suspended Congress MLA and nephew of Punjab BJP chief Sunil Jakhar, clarified that the picture was from the 2022 assembly election campaign. “Many people get pictures taken with us during campaigns. It’s illogical to link that picture to this crime,” he said. ‘We have full trust’ Jagat Verma, elder brother of Sanjay Verma, has expressed satisfaction over the police probe. In a video, Jagat Verma said, “We have full trust in the Punjab Police and we are satisfied with the ongoing police investigation. We humbly appeal to one and all to please stop doing politics over this issue. We appeal to the police to nab the rest of the culprits soon… We trust that we will get justice soon.” State of probe The police said their investigations have revealed that the getaway bike was driven by one Shakti, a daily wager from Azimgarh village of Abohar. While escaping, the attackers lost control of their bike and forcibly snatched another two-wheeler. They later abandoned it on Seeto Road and allegedly fled in a waiting Swift car, driven by Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan. Jaspreet Singh’s family has denied any involvement, alleging that he was picked up from his house in Mardankheri village of Patiala during the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday, and that they later received news of his death. They maintain that Jaspreet was a daily wager with no criminal background. The police said Jaspreet had a criminal background, and released a few pictures of him brandishing weapons. The details of his criminal record haven’t been revealed as of now. At the time of filing this report, the postmortem examination of Jaspreet and Ram was underway at the Abohar Civil Hospital under strict police cover. Meanwhile, gangster Aarzoo Bishnoi had claimed responsibility for the murder on social media, tagging Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar and Maharashtra’s Shivam Lonker hours after the murder. After the alleged encounter, Bishnoi again posted that the real shooters remained at large, and that Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan had no role in the killing. The Punjab unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has identified the Lawrence Bishnoi gang as the perpetrators behind this crime. The police, however, have not confirmed these claims nor provided clarity on the identities of the actual shooters.",e5f95abfc958db5d8cdbca385844d557be4c91c691308cd7d60da76720ec2964,110f9aeaaf40f7b999bac5a862114640

Their online conversations quickly grew into what seemed like a genuine relationship, and soon, talks of marriage followed. But the connection, which appeared to promise a shared future, turned out to be an elaborate cyber scam in which he was allegedly duped of a staggering Rs 1.55 crore over eight months. The investigation revealed that the cybercriminals, operating behind the profile of ‘Anamika,’ gradually gained the complainant’s trust and allegedly requested large sums of money. On the pretence of building a future together, ‘Anamika’ allegedly convinced him to transfer funds to purchase a house without ever having met. Over time, the scammers further manipulated him into investing in various trading apps, luring him with promises of exceptionally high returns, said the police. After spending nearly all his life savings and facing further demands for more money, he realised he had been deceived. When he tried to recover his funds, ‘Anamika’ allegedly abruptly stopped all communication with him. The police filed an FIR in March based on his complaint. The investigation by the cybercrime police station in Pimpri Chinchwad unearthed an elaborate network of mule account handlers allegedly operating from Solapur and with links to cybercriminals masterminding these scams from China. The police zeroed in on one particular mule account registered in Solapur in June. As the account holder was questioned, he spilled the beans on three others from Solapur who had allegedly told him that his bank account would be used for taking funds obtained from gaming applications. As the investigation dug deeper into these three suspects, the police established their identities and roles in the racket. The mule account handlers from Solapur have been identified as Shubham Chandrakant Mantha, 25, a resident of Ashok Chowk; Swapnil Chandulal Baheti, 35, a resident of Hotgi Road; and Prashik Uttam Navghare, 26, a resident of Juna Kumbhani Naka. “Our investigation revealed that Mantha worked for a China-headquartered payment application company, and he and Baheti were in direct contact with the masterminds based out of China. A coordinated search operation was launched for the trio as their roles were confirmed in the probe,” an officer who was part of the probe said. In the second week of June, Mantha and Navghare were arrested from Pune International Airport when they were about to flee to Nepal via Patna. Baheti, too, was placed under arrest. “Investigation revealed an elaborate mule handling and fund siphoning operation with direct links to China,” said an officer. All three suspects are currently in judicial custody.

According to police officials, Sanjeev was surrounded by three to four individuals around 10.30 pm. He was stabbed multiple times in the chest and abdomen with a knife, and then left critically injured on the roadside. The assailants fled the scene immediately after the attack. Soon after, a crowd gathered at the spot, and the PCR was informed. Sanjeev was rushed to the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, Chandigarh, where he succumbed to his injuries during treatment, the police said. The Chandigarh Police have apprehended two minors in connection with the crime. “An FIR has been registered, and the two juveniles have been booked for murder. They will be sent to a juvenile home,” said Vijay Singh, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Chandigarh Police. Sources revealed that the accused allegedly attacked Sanjeev because he was reportedly stalking their sister. The police have not ruled out the involvement of more individuals and are continuing their investigation. Meanwhile, the preliminary postmortem report has stated that the victim died due to punctured vital organs caused by the stabbings. The incident has triggered tension in the area, with residents demanding increased police patrolling and swift justice.

But when public figures cross legal lines, the consequences unfold not just in courtrooms but also under the relentless scrutiny of the public eye. One name that recently forced this uncomfortable truth into the spotlight is Sean “Diddy” Combs, the hip-hop mogul and music industry titan who, after years of whispers and lawsuits, has now been convicted in a federal court. In July 2025, a jury found Combs guilty on two felony counts of transportation to engage in prostitution under the Mann Act, a law dating back to 1910. These charges relate to the coerced travel of his former partner, singer Cassie Ventura, and another woman identified only as “Jane,” both of whom testified during the trial. Combs was acquitted on three other charges, including racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking. Still, the guilty verdict marks a seismic fall for the 55-year-old artist once synonymous with glamour, success, and cultural dominance. Diddy’s story is far from unique. Over the years, several A-listers have been convicted of crimes — from drug possession and assault to manslaughter and tax evasion. This listicle delves into 10 high-profile celebrities with criminal records, focusing only on those with confirmed legal outcomes. Once a towering figure in global music, Diddy’s legacy has been rocked by criminal convictions. In a 2025 federal trial, he was found guilty of two counts of transporting women – including ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura – for prostitution, under the Mann Act. Though acquitted of more serious charges like racketeering and sex trafficking, the felony convictions carry serious legal and reputational consequences. More fallout may follow. Attorney Tony Buzbee claims over 100 men and women have accused Diddy of rape and assault. One woman alleged she was gang raped at age 17 after being drugged at a 2003 party. While Combs’s team dismisses the lawsuits as publicity stunts, the convictions have added weight to the mounting allegations. Sanjay Dutt’s conviction remains one of the most talked-about legal sagas in Indian cinema. In 1993, following the devastating Mumbai bomb blasts, Dutt was arrested under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) for illegally possessing an AK-56 rifle, which was part of a consignment linked to the bombings. Though he was acquitted of terrorism charges, he was convicted in 2006 under the Arms Act for illegal possession of firearms. After years of legal proceedings and appeals, Dutt was sentenced to five years in prison and ultimately served over four years, including time at Yerwada Central Jail. Before becoming Tony Stark, Robert Downey Jr. was one of Hollywood’s most tragic cautionary tales. Struggling with addiction in the 90s, Downey was repeatedly arrested for possession of heroin, cocaine, and unlicensed firearms. He was famously found wandering into a neighbour’s house under the influence and passed out in their bed. In 1999, after multiple probation violations, he was sentenced to three years in prison, though he served roughly a year before early release. In 2009, Bollywood actor Shiney Ahuja was arrested for raping his domestic help—a case that sent shockwaves through the film industry. Though the victim later recanted her statement, the court found the original testimony credible and convicted Ahuja in 2011 under Section 376 (rape) and other charges. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, though he spent about three years in jail before being released on bail pending appeal. Wesley Snipes’ high-flying Hollywood career hit a wall when he was convicted in 2008 on three misdemeanor counts of failing to file federal income tax returns. Prosecutors claimed he hadn’t paid taxes for years, despite earning tens of millions. Though he was acquitted of the more severe felony tax fraud charges, he still served nearly three years in prison. In 1992, boxing champion Mike Tyson was convicted of raping 18-year-old Desiree Washington, a beauty pageant contestant, in an incident that took place at a hotel in Indianapolis in July 1991. The jury found Tyson guilty after about 10 hours of deliberation, rejecting his defense that the encounter was consensual. Tyson was sentenced to six years in prison and served approximately three years before being released on parole in 1995. The conviction shocked the sports world and dramatically altered Tyson’s public image overnight, marking a significant turning point in his career. Despite this setback, Tyson later returned to the boxing ring and expanded his career into entertainment, including notable acting roles such as in The Hangover film series. In 2001, Stranger Things star Winona Ryder was arrested for shoplifting over $5,500 worth of merchandise from a Beverly Hills Saks Fifth Avenue store. She was later convicted of felony grand theft and vandalism, receiving three years’ probation, 480 hours of community service, and fines. The incident damaged her career for years, leading to a hiatus from leading roles in Hollywood. Ryder eventually made a well-received comeback, and her 2000s-era troubles are now often seen as part of the conversation around mental health and celebrity pressure. Shia LaBeouf is known for his acting talent as well as his history of erratic behaviour and legal troubles. Over the years, he has been arrested multiple times for offenses such as disorderly conduct, public intoxication, and drunk driving. One of the most notable incidents occurred in 2017, when LaBeouf was arrested in Savannah, Georgia, for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. During this arrest, he was caught on camera making a racially charged outburst toward police officers. These incidents, along with other arrests for similar behavior, have contributed to his reputation for instability. LaBeouf has also faced civil lawsuits from former partners, most prominently from singer FKA Twigs, who accused him of sexual battery and emotional abuse. While he has not been criminally convicted in these civil cases, the combination of his legal issues and public controversies has overshadowed his career achievements, leading many to view him as a cautionary example of wasted potential in Hollywood. Before becoming a blockbuster actor and producer, Mark Wahlberg had a violent and troubling past. At 16, Wahlberg was charged with attempted murder after assaulting two Vietnamese men during a racially motivated attack. He was convicted of assault and served 45 days in prison. The case drew renewed attention in 2014 when Wahlberg applied for a pardon, sparking criticism from civil rights groups and raising questions about accountability and privilege. Wahlberg has publicly acknowledged his past and expressed remorse, though his request for a pardon was ultimately dropped. Phil Spector, the music genius behind the Wall of Sound, became infamous for a far more sinister reason. In 2009, he was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2003 death of actress Lana Clarkson, who was found shot in his mansion. The trial, his second, after a hung jury, ended in a conviction and a 19-years-to-life prison sentence. Spector died in custody in 2021.",73697cd66a0be055d4dc8648c5cf018f30e228abbd24ff6c1604b1ab6fa4aac5,1676ed0148c17932b20d45559413e540

The doctor received two bullet injuries, and his condition is critical, they said. Ajay Gandhi, Senior Superintendent of Police, Moga, said Dr Aniljit Kamboj, who is in his fifties, was shot at by two men who came to his Harbans Nursing Home at around 2 pm. “The doctor was treating one of them, and discussing medicines when the second man who was standing behind opened fire. Two bullets hit the doctor, including one in the chest. He has been admitted to a private hospital in Moga, and his condition is critical. He is on ventilator,” Gandhi told The Indian Express. He said the police are probing the case from all angles, and checking CCTV footage to identify the suspects. A family member told The Indian Express that Kamboj had received extortion calls from Canada-based designated terrorist Lakhbir Singh Landa, an operative of the banned organization Babbar Khalsa International (BKI). The threat calls were being received since 2022 and the caller was demanding at least Rs 1 crore, said the family member, requesting anonymity. He further said that Kamboj was also given a security cover by the Moga Police but the lone gunman was withdrawn some months ago. Moga SP (investigation) Bal Krishan Singla, said: “An FIR was registered in 2022 after Dr Kamboj had received threat calls. Landa was nominated as an accused in that FIR. However, the family did not inform us about any such latest incident.” Asked if the security cover was withdrawn, he said: “They were having the security cover till some time ago but currently, they had no such threat perception.

The deceased have been identified as dhaba owner Siddarodh Tugudi, 35, his nephew Jagadish Belamagi, 28, and employee Ramanna Bhosga, 40. The police said that the triple murders were in retaliation to a killing that occurred in November last year in connection with a feud between two families who belong to the same village. According to the police, Tugudi and his brothers had murdered a criminal identified as Somu Talikoti over a financial dispute and were released on bail recently. To avenge Talikot’s death, four of his brothers along with associates reportedly orchestrated Wednesday’s attack, the police said. “The police have been warning the families after the murder that took place last year. They belong to the same caste and are relatives. We suspect that these murders were carried out in revenge,” said Kalaburagi City Police Commissioner Sharanappa S D on Thursday. The assailants allegedly stormed the dhaba at 12.45 am, targeting Siddarodh and Jagadish, the police said, adding that they have recovered crucial CCTV footage from a nearby petrol station. The accused had damaged the CCTVs installed at the dhaba. “When the dhaba employees attempted to flee through the back door toward an agricultural field, the attackers pursued them.

The accused were riding a motorcycle with a temporary number plate when they were intercepted by the police. Police said that the arrests are linked to the firing incident that took place on the intervening night of June 20-21.

The accused — Sandeep Jawahar Shah, a resident of Solapur, and Salim Khubbuddin Patel, a resident of Navi Mumbai — were arrested in Mumbai and Sangli earlier this month. As per the CBI, it discovered that the two were involved in duping NEET candidates and their parents by falsely claiming to have connections with officials of the National Testing Agency (NTA) that conducts the examination. As per the CBI, Shah initially demanded Rs 90 lakh from each candidate and agreed to accept Rs 87.5 lakh per candidate. The central agency claimed that Shah and Patel would assure candidates that they would receive details of their purportedly increased marks six hours before the official declaration of results. The accused sought to be released on bail on the grounds that probe was completed and their custodial interrogation was not required. The pleas claimed that there was no recovery at the instance of the applicants and they’ll co-operate with the trial after being released on bail. The CBI, however, opposed the pleas stating that the same be rejected as there other accused persons are yet to be arrested and therefore the custodial interrogation of present applicants would be required. However, special judge VP Desai observed that till date (on June 21) “the investigating officer has nothing concrete to show that till what period the other accused will be arrested”. Merely because the other accused persons are yet to be arrested cannot be a ground for rejection of the bail, the judge added. The court further noted that offence under section 7(A) of Prevention of the Corruption (PC) Act is not punishable in imprisonment of life or death and punishment prescribed is not less than three years but will extend to seven years. “Nothing is brought on record against the applicant that he will not be available for trial. Hence discretion in the nature of bail can be exercised in the favour of applicants,” the court held and granted bail to the two on furnishing personal bond of Rs 50,000 each along with other terms and conditions.",4974f52e05170329fc61b34918e72435efd9c5cfb80bb908d716d1ecea37e141,772d6209c825a13e8bd82758db7362e1

NCRB 2015; PhD Scholar,murder,India; AI; Dalit; the United States; Chicago,the 18th century; working hours; 2019; the 1980s; 2018; 2022,,,,,,,"How AI in criminal justice could spark a human rights crisis for the marginalised Written by Roshan Pandey and Chetna Trivedi We are living in the era commonly referred to as Industry 4.0, where artificial intelligence and information technology are becoming part of almost every aspect of life. From education and healthcare to agriculture and criminal justice, governments around the world, including India, are using AI-based technologies with the claim of improving governance, efficiency and transparency. The purpose of technology, ideally, is to improve human life. But an important question remains: Who controls this technology? History reminds us that technological advancement does not automatically translate into better socio-economic conditions. For instance, when the steam engine was invented in the 18th century, it sparked a massive increase in industrial productivity. Logically, this should have reduced working hours and given people more leisure time. On the contrary, working conditions for labourers worsened. This contradiction occurred because the benefits of technology are controlled by the corporate class, who use it to extract labour without improving the workers’ well-being. The same pattern could repeat itself with AI, if we fail to examine “who” shapes and benefits from its development. AI and society: Shaped by bias AI in its current form reflects existing social biases — caste, gender, religion, skin colour, language, and region. A 2019 Guardian report found women are 47 per cent more likely to be seriously injured and 17 per cent more likely to die in car crashes, as cars and their safety systems are designed for male bodies. Sociologists Donald MacKenzie and Judy Wajcman introduced the concept of the “social shaping of technology (SST)” in the 1980s. The SST argues that technology is not neutral. It is influenced by the social, political, and economic environments in which it is developed. A 2018 MIT study found facial recognition systems had a 0.8 per cent error rate for White men, but 34.7 per cent for dark-skinned women. UN Women warns AI can amplify stereotypes across areas like hiring and healthcare. Studies show AI is not neutral and biased data harms marginalised groups. In criminal justice, this could trigger serious human rights issues. Who represents India’s database? In India, there is no specific legal framework to regulate the use of AI. Yet tools are being widely adopted by both government and private institutions. Large language models and generative AI systems operate on existing datasets, but these datasets themselves are shaped by unequal access. The CSDS 2019 report pointed out a deep digital divide in India. A significant part of the population, especially women, Dalits, Adivasis, minorities, and rural communities — has limited or no access to the Internet. Oxfam’s India Inequality Report 2022 found that women use the Internet 33 per cent less than men. Only 31 per cent of rural Indians are online, compared to 67 per cent in urban areas. The situation is even more skewed when it comes to caste, with “upper” caste people having far more representation in digital spaces than Dalits and Adivasis. This means that the data on which AI systems in India are trained does not fairly represent the country’s social reality. As a result, AI tools built on such biased datasets risk reinforcing existing inequalities. AI in criminal justice: A threat to the marginalised? The NCRB’s Prison Statistics 2018 reveals deep inequalities in India’s justice system: Two-thirds of prisoners are Dalits, Adivasis, or OBCs, 19 per cent are Muslim, and 66 per cent are illiterate or have not studied beyond class X. NCRB 2015 data shows over 55 per cent of undertrials come from Dalit, Adivasi, or Muslim backgrounds. This raises concerns about using AI in criminal justice, as biased data can reinforce existing discrimination. Recent examples highlight these risks. The Punjab and Haryana High Court used ChatGPT in a bail rejection for a murder case, setting a troubling precedent. Amazon’s 2014 AI hiring tool, scrapped for bias against women, shows how AI can replicate past injustices. In India, where power in government, corporates, and media is concentrated among the privileged, AI in recruitment and policing without ethical safeguards could further marginalise vulnerable communities. Experts often argue that developed countries possess more advanced AI systems to control crime, whereas developing nations lack the tangible and human resources needed to use such technologies effectively. However, even in the United States, AI-driven systems have demonstrated significant flaws. For instance, the COMPAS algorithm used in the criminal justice system has been shown to be twice as likely to assign higher risk scores to Black defendants compared to White defendants charged with similar offenses. Similarly, the NAACP has raised concerns on the Chicago crime prediction algorithm and its inherent systemic bias against Black communities. These examples highlight the misuse of AI-based technologies that disproportionately affect marginalised groups and violate their human rights. The central government in India is increasingly deploying tech-based tools in the criminal justice system. Notable initiatives include the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS), a nationwide database of crimes and offenders; the Inter-operable Criminal Justice System (ICJS), which enables information sharing among various state institutions; and the National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS), designed to assist in identifying suspects and missing persons. However, the use of such systems in the absence of a well-defined legal and regulatory framework raises concerns. These measures may reinforce systemic bias and lead to further marginalisation of communities that already lack adequate representation and voice within institutional records. The need for inclusive and ethical technology India holds enormous diversity but also deep inequalities. The databases currently used in AI development do not reflect the complexities of Indian society. While AI has many exciting possibilities, it also raises serious ethical and social questions that must be addressed before it is adopted widely. Therefore, the government must enact regulations to ensure AI remains inclusive, transparent, and accountable. Technology must not reinforce existing stigmas and exclusion and rather become a tool for empowerment. AI’s development should be centred around the needs of the marginalised communities to ensure equitable progress.

All I could think of was the plane was going to Vancouver and we were on the wrong flight. On the ground, the FBI and the Seattle Police Department rushed to get the money, parachutes, and emergency personnel ready for the landing.The plane landed at 5.46pm, and the money was handed over by an airport staffer — 10,000 unmarked $20 bills in a cloth bag.The passengers got off. The flight attendants retrieved the parachutes. He told them he didn’t need the instructions on how to use them.The plane took off again a few hours later with only Cooper and the flight crew aboard, followed by three fighter jets.This time it was heading for Mexico City, but the hijacker would not make it that far.The black tie DB Cooper left behind on the plane he hijacked. (Supplied: FBI)As the plane travelled somewhere between Seattle and Reno around 8pm, Cooper ordered the flight attendants to open the staircase at the back of the plane.Then he tied the bag of money around his waist, donned his parachutes, and jumped.It was the end of the hijacking, but only the beginning of an investigation that would continue for decades.Suspects, interviews and a $30,000 hoax The new files released this month are the latest in a series to be declassified under the Trump administration.The first lot of more than 400 pages were published online in March.Bundles of crumbling $20 bills from DB Cooper's ransom money were unearthed by a small boy on a sandbar in the Columbia River in 1980. (Supplied: FBI)The documents, at times heavily redacted, outline leads and suspects pursued by the FBI over the years.At one point, a man in a wheelchair became their key suspect, only to be ruled out. It is believed that the hijacker in this case has full use of all of his extremities and witnesses did not tell of any physical disability, the agent wrote. A man confined to a wheel chair [sic] did not hijack the plane in this case. Other men investigated included former pilots and members of multiple different skydiving clubs who bore a resemblance to Cooper.Men who did not resemble the artist’s sketch but who had mentioned different ways to hijack an airplane or suggested the way to hijack [and] escape would be … using a parachute were also reported to police.Several documents include long and redacted lists of suspects whose photographs were shown to witnesses without success.A contributing editor for Newsweek magazine, Karl Fleming, told the FBI he had placed an ad in multiple newspapers asking DB Cooper to contact him.Heists that shocked the worldThe plane hijacking by DB Cooper is just one of a series of high-profile robberies which have hit the headlines around the world.The ad included his home phone number.He said he had been contacted and met multiple times with a man who identified himself as Cooper.At one point, he said he had been shown several $20 bills he said he was 98 per cent positive matched copies of the ransom money shown to him by an unknown source.He handed over $US30,000 ($45,810) for the exclusive interview, publishing a three-part series detailing Cooper’s side of the story.Two men were later convicted and sentenced to serve time in federal prison for impersonating Cooper and pocketing the money.The rest of the files do not draw any definitive conclusion.'DB Cooper, Where Are You?' In the years since the hijacking, the story has become part of American pop culture history.By 1972, T-shirts bearing the phrase DB Cooper, Where Are You? were already appearing in novelty shops across the west coast.A magazine cover featuring DB Cooper published in 1976, included in National Archives files. (National Archives)There have been dozens of fiction and non-fiction books about the case, as well as references in film and television.In David Lynch’s 1990 TV series Twin Peaks, the main character is named Dale Bartholomew Cooper — a nod to the now infamous hijacker.More recently, DB Cooper was revealed to be Loki in the Disney+ series Loki, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.An annual CooperCon convention is held in Seattle, letting Cooper enthusiasts and researchers swap theories.None of it has led to any answers.Max Shaffer, then chief of security for the Seattle region of the Federal Aviation Administration, told the New York Times in 1972 he believed Cooper was dead. I feel that one of these days some hunter in Oregon or Washington is going to find the skeleton of this man, he said.As of July 12, 2016, the FBI had officially ended their investigation, leaving it as one of the longest cold cases in the agency’s history. The mystery surrounding the hijacking of a Northwest Orient Airlines flight in 1971 by a still-unknown individual resulted in significant international attention and a decades-long manhunt, they said in a statement. Evidence obtained during the course of the investigation will now be preserved for historical purposes at FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC.

(Facebook)Their intelligence on Mr Ayik came after he was unwittingly recruited into spreading a police-bugged app, called AN0M, into the underworld by the AFP.The joint AFP and FBI operation involved planting the devices into the hands of criminals and watching on as they used it to organise murders, drug shipments and beatings in Australia and abroad.No AN0M cases against anyone charged in Australia have ever revealed what, if any, link they had to Mr Ayik, deepening the mystery of who one senior law enforcement source described as a Mr Big of the underworld .But a trove of court documents from the United States, released in recent months, reveal his alleged role in luring his mates into the police trap.The man behind the 'Oscar' monikerAs part of their investigation the AFP revealed how rival bikies and crime families would work together using AN0M to supply drugs all over Australia.In court documents from related AN0M cases in the United States, prosecutors described Mr Ayik as an influencer — a role that proved a profitable side hustle.In one filing referring to Mr Ayik under his AN0M username Oscar , one of his associates described how all the profits from the sale of 100 devices would go straight to him.Alleged Australian drug lord Hakan Ayik poses in a Facebook profile photo. (Facebook)That transaction would earn him $75,000 in Bitcoin, according to court documents.The same underling, the documents said, would go on to discuss in messages on the device how Mr Ayik and the crew could start a VIP service for certain AN0M customers.Others paint the picture of Mr Ayik as being the go-to person for AN0M, who would go on to sell more than 12,000 devices as well as allegedly leading the Comanchero from overseas.The Comanchero are one of the most powerful bikie gangs in Australia, who suffered a power struggle during Sydney's recent gangland war.What the AN0M device looked like, before it was revealed to be a police Trojan horse app. (Supplied: AFP)In another court document from the United States, an underling asks Mr Ayik: Touching base with you in relation to AN0M device we prepared for client Tiger? Another describes how Mr Ayik is alleged to have sent clients to those under him and how those clients paid cash through a family member of Mr Ayik.When news of the AN0M operation first broke, rumours from underworld and police sources purported Mr Ayik had fled for his safety to either Syria or Iraq.Two years later in 2023, 46-year-old Mr Ayik would be apprehended shirtless by Turkish police in a posh apartment belonging to him in the heart of Istanbul.Hakan Ayik, during his now infamous capture in Istanbul in 2023. (Reuters: Turkish Interior Ministry/Handout )Charges with a 262-year jail termMr Ayik lived a life of luxury while on the run in Türkiye, though the alleged drug kingpin will likely never face justice down under.Among the lavish hotels, cars and businesses in Istanbul, Mr Ayik was far from going to ground while wanted for a raft of serious drug offences across the globe.Vast swathes of his wealth have now been seized by Turkish authorities who are prosecuting him for a series of alleged drug crimes and money laundering offences.If convicted he faces 262 years in prison.Mr Ayik was rumoured to be a billion-dollar bikie while posting flashy social media snaps on the run and estimates of his wealth ranged from $250 million to as high as $1 billion.The former Sydney bikie is also wanted on a racketeering indictment in the US and appears on watch lists for police authorities from Europe to Australia.Hotels fit for a kingThe Kings Cross Hotel in Istanbul, owned by alleged Sydney crime boss Hakan Ayik.

(Supplied: Supreme Court of Western Australia)Instead, the pellets hit and killed Ralph Matthews Cox, who did not know Nguyen-Ha and had no involvement in the drug world.The jury deliberated for two days before finding Nguyen-Ha guilty of one charge of murder, as well as five counts of doing an act likely to endanger life.Final act in series of shootingsDuring his trial, Nguyen-Ha admitted firing the gun twice but claimed he replaced the shotgun shells with pellets filled with rock salt.He told the court it was his alleged accomplice, Matthew Gempton, who fired a third, fatal shot with a different gun.Gempton, a self-described debt collector, already received a reduced sentence for manslaughter over his role in the shooting after agreeing to be a key witness in Nguyen-Ha's trial.He admitted being Nguyen-Ha's driver in the shooting but said it was his accomplice who fired the gun.Police found Ralph Matthews Cox critically injured at a house in Landsdale in January 2022. (ABC News)The intended target of the shooting, Anthony Prior, admitted in court he had bashed Nguyen-Ha and stolen tens of thousands of dollars from him in late 2021, in a set-up which involved fake drugs.That triggered two earlier shootings at homes in Perth's northern suburbs in which Nguyen-Ha, along with Gempton, were targeting Prior.The prosecution maintained that in those shootings Nguyen-Ha was not a mere bystander but was a planner, and that he was indeed the lone gunman in the final Landsdale shooting.On that night, Mr Cox and his partner were asleep in their front bedroom and stirred when they heard someone outside.He said I've been hit , when he was shot, the court heard.Nguyen-Ha will face a sentencing hearing on August 22.

It was followed by the air wing and police on the ground as it drove through suburbs including Melbourne, Port Melbourne, Spotswood, Carnegie, Sunshine, Dandenong and Point Cook.The van was driving erratically over the West Gate Bridge. (ABC News)In the vision, the van can be seen exiting the Princes Freeway at Palmers Road and continuing along Dunnings Road, Point Cook, hitting light poles and swerving to avoid other cars.The vision then shows the van slowing down before a man jumps through the driver's side window while the van is still moving.The 36-year-old man, from Point Cook, is struck by an unmarked police car as he tries to run across the road.Officers then descend upon him. Later he can be seen sitting on the footpath in handcuffs.The man was seen climbing through the window of the van before jumping out. (ABC News)A Victoria Police spokesperson said the van had hit several parked and moving vehicles. At this stage, it is understood there are no serious injuries. Paramedics treated him at the scene before taking him away in an ambulance. He sustained non-life threatening injuries, was arrested, and has been transported to hospital under police guard, a police spokesperson said.The driver is yet to be interviewed by police.Police arrest a man after a pursuit on Friday afternoon. (ABC News )Police say they did not deliberately hit manActing Inspector Dean Pickering from Victoria Police said the officer driving the car that hit the man was not expecting him to jump out. He wasn't anticipating that that man was going to come out the window and run like he did, he said. They've taken evasive action pretty quickly, and obviously we have seen the collision. It certainly wasn't a deliberate course of action as a way to arrest our offender. He said it was not yet clear how many cars were damaged during the pursuit. It wasn't a pursuit for the entirety of what was going on … there were periods were it just being followed by the air wing. There were some computers in the car that were being tracked, he said.

The teenager was spared convictions but ordered to participate in family conferencing and placed on a six-month good behaviour bond.abc.net.au/news/teen-sentenced-for-vigilante-ambush-attacks/105511878Link copiedShareShare articleA teenager involved in vigilante attacks on men lured to meet-ups via social media under the guise of sexual encounters, has been spared convictions for his crimes.The now 18-year-old, was sentenced in Adelaide's Youth Court this week for his involvement in two separate ambushes instigated by his lifelong friend .In sentencing, Magistrate Tracee Micallef said the teen's friend had pretended to be an underage girl on social media and had sexualised conversations with a man aged in his 30s, before luring him to meet in person. The victim thought he was meeting to engage in a sexual interaction with what he thought was a young girl, she said.Ms Micallef said the teenager, who was 17 at the time, only became involved in the offending when his friend invited him to the planned meeting with the man in February. The [friend] came to you and said he had organised to meet up with a paedophile, Ms Micallef said. You agreed to go with him without making any further inquiries as to what was planned or what was happening … you clearly knew that a confrontation was likely to occur. 'Humiliating and degrading' act filmedDuring the confrontation, which involved a group of youths, the man was threatened with a machete and blocked from leaving.Ms Micallef said the man was forced to transfer money to one of the other youths' accounts, and told to remove his shirt and kiss the shoes of the group or he would be assaulted.The man initially refused and was punched. As he was in fear, he did what was asked of him and it was filmed — that is the humiliating and degrading act, Ms Micallef said.She said the victim fled and later tried to have the money returned via his bank but stopped the investigation when he received threats that the footage and embarrassing messages would be released to his family and workplace.Ms Micallef said the victim would always have a concern that the video footage of him is still out there in the cloud somewhere .She said the teen had agreed he was equally responsible for the offending despite not being the instigator or the planner .The teenager had pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated robbery, blackmail and engaging in humiliating or degrading filming in relation to that incident, along with aggravated robbery and attempted aggravated robbery in relation to a second incident in April this year.The men were lured to meet with the youths via social media. (AP: Jenny Kane)Ms Micallef said the second incident involved ambushing two men who were lured to a public area, for what they thought would be a sexual experiment, or interaction, with a third male .She said the two men saw someone in the dark , and were asked, but refused, to go back to their house or a school before they were threatened with a machete.A group of youths, including the now-18-year-old, assaulted the men — one of whom was put in a headlock — and tried to take their keys and wallets, but the men escaped and alerted the police.Ms Micallef said the teen was again not involved in the set-up, nor wielding the machete or making threats but was willingly present.She said the teen — who had spent about two weeks in youth detention after his arrest — had a stable home life, was well-behaved at school and had provided multiple glowing character references to the court.The magistrate said the teen had recognised that despite being long-time friends, the youth who organised the meetings was now a negative influence on your behaviour .'Vigilante behaviour is not acceptable'She said the court had been told that aside from his close friend, he did not know the other youths involved and had been dragged into the offending. Whilst I can accept that the first time you joined your childhood friend you may have not been aware of the planned robbery or humiliation or blackmail … but you did participate in it, she said. You did not leave, nor did you try to stop it. Even if you did nothing but stand there, by your presence you made it frightening for the victim and supported the others in that action. I can also accept that to some extent you may have thought that you were dealing with, or somehow punishing someone who was behaving inappropriately, or about to. However, this behaviour cannot be condoned in any way … this type of vigilante behaviour is not acceptable. Ms Micallef diverted the youth to family conferencing for the offences against the first victim and imposed a six-month good behaviour bond for the second incident. She did not impose any convictions.Posted Thu 10 Jul 2025 at 8:05pmThursday 10 Jul 2025 at 8:05pmThu 10 Jul 2025 at 8:05pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesIn Australia’s aim for housing abundance NIMBY has become a ‘dirty word’Topic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Housing longread headerPrivate tobacco shop ATMs generate triple normal transactionsTopic:CrimePhoto shows Boxes of cigarettes surrounded by Australian cash.Starc strikes under lights to remove makeshift West Indies openerLIVEPhoto shows A cricketer holds up his arm in celebrationSix years after Kumanjayi Walker's shooting, a reckoning within NT police is inescapableTopic:Black Deaths In CustodyPhoto shows a wall covered in aboriginal street artDonald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradePhoto shows Donald Trump speaking to the media in the White House Press Room.Popular nowEagles' Graham handed four-match ban for 'highly offensive' homophobic slurTopic:AFLPhoto shows Jack Graham after a 2025 AFL match for the Eagles.Man fatally shot by officer was husband of woman in 'melee', police sayTopic:PolicePhoto shows nsw police cars outside a coles at mount druitt westfield after a man was fatally shot by policePrivate tobacco shop ATMs generate triple normal transactionsTopic:CrimePhoto shows Boxes of cigarettes surrounded by Australian cash.Related topicsAdelaideCourtsCrimeLaw, Crime and JusticeSASentencingTop StoriesIn Australia’s aim for housing abundance NIMBY has become a ‘dirty word’Topic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Housing longread headerPrivate tobacco shop ATMs generate triple normal transactionsTopic:CrimeStarc strikes under lights to remove makeshift West Indies openerTopic:CricketSix years after Kumanjayi Walker's shooting, a reckoning within NT police is inescapableTopic:Black Deaths In CustodyDonald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradeJust InTwo French women charged for allegedly importing 32kg of meth at Brisbane AirportTopic:Drug Offences8m ago8 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 1:57amRediscovery of pre-colonial Perth place names committed to filmTopic:Indigenous Culture14m ago14 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 1:51amEagles' Graham handed four-match ban for 'highly offensive' homophobic slurTopic:AFL27m ago27 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 1:38amUS review of AUKUS incomplete as cost of defence boost revealedTopic:Federal Government46m ago46 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 1:19amMore Just InBack to top In Australia’s aim for housing abundance NIMBY has become a ‘dirty word’Topic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Housing longread header Private tobacco shop ATMs generate triple normal transactionsTopic:CrimePhoto shows Boxes of cigarettes surrounded by Australian cash.

The prosecutor alleges the three acted in agreement, motivated by revenge against the teenager.What's next? The judge has told the jury they must reach a unanimous verdict for each accused who faces three charges. abc.net.au/news/charlie-gander-supreme-court-murder-trial-jury-deliberates/105517906Link copiedShareShare articleA jury has begun deliberating in the trial of three people accused of kidnapping, murdering and burning the body of a 19-year-old in northern Victoria in December 2022. The remains of Charlie Gander's body were found in a burnt-out car at Bunbartha on Christmas Eve, 2022.Kylie Stott, Dimitri D'Elio and Danny Clarke have pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, murder and arson in a trial painted by the prosecution as a desire for revenge against Charlie for ratting out their associate to the police.The jury was shown photos taken by Victoria Police of the burnt car, which contained the remains of Charlie Gander's body. (Supplied: Supreme Court of Victoria)At the time of the alleged offending, Ms Stott was aged 37, Mr D'Elio 24 and Mr Clarke 38.All three have pleaded not guilty.The 12 jurors have begun deliberating after 30 days of hearings, including about 41 witnesses made up of pathologists, DNA experts, emergency services and police officers. The jury also heard statements read out by the prosecutor from Mr Gander's girlfriend and his father Richard Gander, including final texts between the pair. Police evidence cost teenager 'dearly', says CrownIn his final address, Mr Gibson argued that each of the accused was guilty of the three charges because each of them was part of an agreement, arrangement or understanding with the others to kidnap Charlie Gander, to murder Charlie Gander and to burn the Ford Territory with Charlie Gander's body in it .Mr Gibson told the jury the alleged motive was Mr Gander's cooperation with police investigating a firearms breach by Tyson May, who was a good friend of Ms Stott. Mr Gander was also friends with Mr May and would hang out with him, the court heard.Following a police raid in Shepparton in November 2022, Mr Gander gave a police interview and made a witness statement about Mr May possessing a firearm. The court heard Gander's body contained high levels of ice, which could not be ruled out as a cause of death. (Supplied: Gander family)Mr May was under a firearms prohibition order, Mr Gibson said. A disc with the record of Mr Gander's police interview found its way into the hands of others , Mr Gibson said. It cost him dearly, he said.The court heard a kitchen knife wrapped in a bloodstained tea towel from under a car seat had a mixed DNA profile of four people, including Mr Gander. Forensic pathologist Paul Bedford, who conducted Mr Gander's autopsy, previously told the court extensive fire damage to the body meant the cause of death could not be ascertained.He also told the court toxicology reports had found very high levels of the drug methylamphetamine, commonly known as ice, which may have contributed to Mr Gander's death.Defence arguments Justice Michael Croucher presented a summary of the defence counsel's arguments to the court before the jury began deliberating.Daniel Sala, acting for Ms Stott, has rejected the prosecution's arguments that she was key in orchestrating the acts against Mr Gander and urged the jury to find her not guilty of murder or arson. Paul Kounnas, acting on behalf of Mr D'Elio, has argued Ms Stott and Mr Clarke were the prime movers in the alleged crimes and that Mr D'Elio was dragged along and used as a patsy . Emergency services found the car on fire on a dirt road in Bunbartha in Victoria's north. (Supplied: Supreme Court of Victoria)The court heard Mr D'Elio, who was in a relationship with Ms Stott, did not know Mr Gander or Mr Clarke and had no skin in the game .Christopher Terry, acting on behalf of Mr Clarke, has argued his client did not intend to kill Mr Gander or enter into any agreement to do so. He said there was no evidence of Mr Clarke's hatred towards Mr Gander or proof of an agreement, and that his client had been dragged into a terrible crime .Charges heard togetherJustice Croucher instructed the jury that they must reach a unanimous verdict for each of the accused, who each face three charges. The jury heard they may find the accused guilty of manslaughter as an alternative if they are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the higher charge of murder. Justice Croucher told the jury manslaughter did not require an intent to kill, but there must be an intentional assault that was dangerous and posed serious injury. He also told the jury their task did not include making moral judgements.He noted jurors had been tasked with not one trial but 12 separate decisions, with the three accused facing three charges and the potential for manslaughter. The 12 charges are being heard together for convenience, and the jury must not allow this fact to usurp justice and must consider each charge separately, Justice Croucher said.Posted Thu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:39amThursday 10 Jul 2025 at 9:39amThu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:39am, updated Thu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:41amThursday 10 Jul 2025 at 9:41amThu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:41amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesIn Australia’s aim for housing abundance NIMBY has become a ‘dirty word’Topic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Housing longread headerPrivate tobacco shop ATMs generate triple normal transactionsTopic:CrimePhoto shows Boxes of cigarettes surrounded by Australian cash.Starc strikes under lights to remove makeshift West Indies openerLIVEPhoto shows A cricketer holds up his arm in celebrationSix years after Kumanjayi Walker's shooting, a reckoning within NT police is inescapableTopic:Black Deaths In CustodyPhoto shows a wall covered in aboriginal street artDonald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradePhoto shows Donald Trump speaking to the media in the White House Press Room.Popular nowEagles' Graham handed four-match ban for 'highly offensive' homophobic slurTopic:AFLPhoto shows Jack Graham after a 2025 AFL match for the Eagles.Man fatally shot by officer was husband of woman in 'melee', police sayTopic:PolicePhoto shows nsw police cars outside a coles at mount druitt westfield after a man was fatally shot by policePrivate tobacco shop ATMs generate triple normal transactionsTopic:CrimePhoto shows Boxes of cigarettes surrounded by Australian cash.Related topicsBunbarthaCourtsCrimeMelbourneSheppartonTop StoriesIn Australia’s aim for housing abundance NIMBY has become a ‘dirty word’Topic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Housing longread headerPrivate tobacco shop ATMs generate triple normal transactionsTopic:CrimeStarc strikes under lights to remove makeshift West Indies openerTopic:CricketSix years after Kumanjayi Walker's shooting, a reckoning within NT police is inescapableTopic:Black Deaths In CustodyDonald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradeJust InTwo French women charged for allegedly importing 32kg of meth at Brisbane AirportTopic:Drug Offences8m ago8 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 1:57amRediscovery of pre-colonial Perth place names committed to filmTopic:Indigenous Culture15m ago15 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 1:51amEagles' Graham handed four-match ban for 'highly offensive' homophobic slurTopic:AFL27m ago27 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 1:38amUS review of AUKUS incomplete as cost of defence boost revealedTopic:Federal Government46m ago46 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 1:19amMore Just InBack to top In Australia’s aim for housing abundance NIMBY has become a ‘dirty word’Topic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Housing longread header Private tobacco shop ATMs generate triple normal transactionsTopic:CrimePhoto shows Boxes of cigarettes surrounded by Australian cash.

Ms McGuire was reported missing by her family in April last year, and her body was later found in a burnt-out vehicle south-west of Ballarat. Hannah McGuire, 23, was found dead inside a burnt-out vehicle in April last year. (Supplied: GoFundMe)In opening remarks, chief prosecutor Kristie Churchill told the court Ms McGuire's three-year relationship with Mr Young was controlling and turbulent , and included a series of intervention orders.In one instance, Ms Churchill said Mr Young called Ms McGuire 129 times in a single day.The prosecution will argue that Mr Young murdered Ms McGuire at the Sebastopol home they once shared, before putting her body in the footwell of a car, driving her out to a remote location, and setting both on fire. Ms Churchill told the court that autopsy reports concluded Ms McGuire was dead before the fire started. The prosecution said it would argue Mr Young staged Ms McGuire's death to look like a suicide and systematically deleted evidence.The prosecution rejected Lachlan Young's guilty plea to manslaughter. (Instagram)It is alleged Mr Young seized Ms McGuire's phone post murder and sent text messages as Ms McGuire to her mother and himself. I'm sorry mum, I thought this was the right decision. I tried to heal and cope with it all but I'm not ok, read the beginning of one text Mr Young sent from Ms McGuire's phone to her mother.The prosecution will also argue Mr Young transferred thousands of dollars to Ms McGuire's mother and himself and continued to spread a bunch of lies to friends, family, and police in the days after her murder.Floral tributes were left for Hannah McGuire at the site where her remains were found. (AAP: Con Chronis )Charge of murderMr Young's defence, led by Glenn Casement, told the court the 22-year old man made a very serious admission pleading guilty to manslaughter.Mr Casement said although Mr Young made a series of appalling, bad choices in an attempt to obscure what he did, he did not kill Ms McGuire with murderous intent .The Supreme Court will sit in Ballarat for the next five weeks. (ABC News: Julia Bergin)The defence will argue Mr Young's actions were foolish and shameful , but Ms McGuire's death was an unplanned and spontaneous event .Throughout the next five weeks, the court will hear from a number of witnesses, including friends, family, medical experts, and the man who assisted Mr Young to dispose of the car containing Ms McGuire's body. What's next?A jury of 14 was empanelled on Wednesday morning and will be required to make a unanimous decision, beyond reasonable doubt, on whether Mr Young murdered Ms McGuire.There are four key elements they need to satisfy: that Mr Young caused the death of Ms McGuire, that he did so consciously, voluntarily and deliberately, that he intended to kill or cause serious injury, and that there was no lawful justification or excuse for his actions.

The evidence will be alleged that they have come from China into Australia to commit these crimes and then return. Assistant Commissioner Wood said those targeted were some of the most vulnerable in the community, who allegedly lost $3 million. They, I would describe, are very, very vulnerable people, he said. The majority are female and elderly. They underpin the word vulnerability. And that's what makes this scam, this crime, let's not call it a scam, this crime, so serious. They are like piranhas; they are circling around vulnerable people and they are robbing them, at times, of huge amounts of money.

There's no rules with these people; they're predators. When they see an opportunity, when they need to work as a group they will work as a group, he said. It is extremely sad to see how they act, targeting individuals who are vulnerable, who are elderly. They have no chance.

The court heard the attack on March 20, 2024, targeted businesses linked to Ukraine and was planned by agents of Wagner Group, acting on behalf of Russian military intelligence.The warehouse targeted by the trio stored aid and Starlink satellite devices vital for Ukraine's defence against Russia's continuing invasion.The jury found Jakeem Rose, Ugnius Asmena and Nii Mensah guilty of aggravated arson. (AP/Metropolitan Police)CCTV shown to the court showed Rose and Mensah near the warehouse shortly before setting fire to it.The fire caused around 1 million pounds ($2 million) worth of damage. A fourth man, Paul English, 61, was cleared of any wrongdoing.Prosecutors said the attack was orchestrated by Dylan Earl, 21, and Jake Reeves, 23, who had previously pleaded guilty to aggravated arson on behalf of the Wagner Group.Dylan Earl, left and Jake Reeves, right, pleaded guilty to orchestrating the attack on behalf of Wagner. (AP/Metropolitan Police)Earl also became the first person convicted under the National Security Act when he admitted his role in a plot targeting a wine shop and restaurant in London's upmarket Mayfair district, with plans to kidnap the owner, a high-profile critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.Earl exchanged hundreds of messages with an apparent Wagner handler who encouraged him to find links with soccer hooligans, Irish republican militants and high-profile criminal groups.Arson is latest Russia-linked incidentThe arson attack was the latest incident involving allegations of malign activity by Moscow in Britain.Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the London police's Counter Terrorism Command, said both plots involving Earl showed the Russian state projecting activity into the United Kingdom .He said Russia and other states such as Iran had adapted to British authorities' response to hostile activity, with some 20 per cent of counterterrorism police's work coming from foreign states.The warehouse in East London was storing Starlink satellite equipment bound for Ukraine. (AP/Metropolitan Police) We've made the UK a hostile operating environment for those governments but, as a result, they've diversified and are now contacting relatively young people to act on their behalf as proxies in doing their activity, Commander Murphy said.The Kremlin has denied the accusations, and its embassy in London has rejected any part in the warehouse fire, saying the British government repeatedly blames Russia for anything bad that happens in Britain.In March, a group of Bulgarians were convicted of being directed by Wirecard fugitive Jan Marsalek to spy for Russian intelligence.British authorities say that, since the expulsion of Russian spies following the 2018 poisoning of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal, Moscow has had to rely mainly on criminals motivated by financial gain, or those with existing grievances, to carry out activities on its behalf.AP/ReutersPosted Tue 8 Jul 2025 at 3:31pmTuesday 8 Jul 2025 at 3:31pmTue 8 Jul 2025 at 3:31pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesIn Australia’s aim for housing abundance NIMBY has become a ‘dirty word’Topic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Housing longread headerPrivate tobacco shop ATMs generate triple normal transactionsTopic:CrimePhoto shows Boxes of cigarettes surrounded by Australian cash.Starc strikes under lights to remove makeshift West Indies openerLIVEPhoto shows A cricketer holds up his arm in celebrationSix years after Kumanjayi Walker's shooting, a reckoning within NT police is inescapableTopic:Black Deaths In CustodyPhoto shows a wall covered in aboriginal street artDonald Trump announces 30pc tariffs against EU, MexicoTopic:TradePhoto shows Donald Trump speaking to the media in the White House Press Room.Related storiesA 'reckless campaign of Russian sabotage' has been uncovered.

Today, the body of former Transport Minister Roman Staravoit was found in his private car with a gunshot wound in the Odintsovo district, the Investigative Committee said in a statement. The main version [considered] is suicide, it added.Russian state media and news agencies said Mr Staravoit shot himself.There were conflicting reports about the timing of his death.Various Russian media cited law enforcement sources as saying a pistol belonging to Mr Starovoit had been found alongside his body in his car.Just hours earlier, a presidential decree announced Mr Starovoit's departure after barely a year in the job, but gave no reason for his dismissal.The statement read: Roman Starovoit was relieved of the post of Minister of Transport. Political analysts and Russian state media speculated after his sacking that he may have been dismissed in connection with an investigation into corruption in the Kursk region, which he was governor of for over five years.In April this year, Mr Starovoit's successor as governor, Alexei Smirnov, was charged with embezzling money earmarked for defence purposes amid accusations that the funds earmarked for border defences had been stolen, leaving Kursk more vulnerable to Ukrainian attack.Roman Starovoit served as the transport minister under Russian President Vladimir Putin. (Reuters: Sputnik/Alexander Kazakov)Ukrainian forces launched a counteroffensive in Kursk last year, three months after Mr Starovoit left his role as governor to become transport minister.Mr Starovoit's firing also came after another weekend of travel chaos at Russian airports following Ukrainian drone attacks.Pressed earlier on Monday by reporters on whether his dismissal meant Mr Putin had lost trust in Mr Starovoit over Kursk, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said a loss of trust is mentioned if there is a loss of trust . There is no such wording in the [Kremlin] decree.

Suarez pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit bank and mail fraud, along with aggravated identity theft. He faces several years in prison, including mandatory-minimum punishment of two years for the ID theft conviction, at his sentencing hearing in September before U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams.Suarez was indicted in 2023 but was living in Panama City, Panama, at the time. In early 2025, he was arrested in Panama and brought to South Florida to face the charges. According to a factual statement filed with his plea agreement, here’s how Suarez carried out the scam during an FBI-led undercover operation:More than 80 fraudulent checksIn March 2022, Suarez told a confidential informant that he had access to the bank account of an elderly person, who was 82 years old at the time. Suarez created and mailed dozens of falsified checks from Panama to South Florida to the victim’s bank with directions to cash them and return half of the money to his account at Bank of America. The ill-gotten proceeds were wired to his Miami-based company, Online Electronics.To carry out the scheme, Suarez’s fraudulent checks contained forged signatures designed to resemble that of the victim’s on a signature card at Truist Bank.“In total, Suarez and his co-conspirators stole $803,146 from [the victim’s] bank account at Truist through the issuance of more than 80 fraudulent checks to numerous different payees, including at least five individuals and various companies,” according to the factual statement signed by the defendant, his lawyer and a prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami.The statement also said the elderly person reviewed the names of the individuals and companies involved in the fraudulent check transactions. The person did not authorize any of them.The case, investigated by the FBI, Secret Service and FDIC’s Office of Inspector General, was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Thor Pogozelski.This story was originally published July 10, 2025 at 11:32 AM.

Police won’t talk By Grethel Aguila and Charles Rabin July 10, 2025 5:40 PM More than a month after a Miami-Dade judge signed an arrest warrant for former NFL star Antonio Brown, saying he tried to shoot someone outside a celebrity boxing event in Little Haiti, the former all pro has not been taken into custody. Miami Police are not saying what they’re doing to bring him back. Jason Getz Jason Getz-USA TODAY Sports A month after being charged with attempted murder, former NFL star Antonio Brown has posted videos on social media flaunting his lavish lifestyle abroad — riding around in expensive cars and sauntering on a yacht overlooking Dubai’s skyscrapers.It’s almost as if Brown, 37, were taunting police. But Miami Police will not say whether they consider Brown on the run — or if they’re working to bring him back to the U.S. to face trial.A Miami-Dade judge signed off on Brown’s arrest warrant a month ago. But police don’t appear to be looking for him and refuse to discuss the case. There’s also no record or court date for Brown in the database of Miami-Dade circuit court records.READ MORE: Antonio Brown charged with attempted murder after shooting at Miami boxing eventIn a video uploaded to X on Thursday, Brown is seen celebrating his birthday in a red Ferrari 812 GTS and hanging out with his young sons on the water.

After the shooting, Brown said on social media that he was attacked by people trying to steal his jewelry.

The jewelry designer spent a month in jail in the United Arab Emirates, documents show, before proving that Brown lied.READ MORE: Antonio Brown’s false accusations put Miami jeweler in Dubai jail for month: lawsuitPeople accused of crimes usually negotiate with authorities to surrender upon their return. Brown had an attorney early on who secured him a $10,000 bond, including house arrest. As of Thursday, it’s unclear if Brown was being represented by an attorney. Another unknown: whether prosecutors will continue to honor the bond agreement in place. Brown could be detained by the FBI or U.S. Marshals if Miami Police or the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office request that the federal agencies issue a warrant for Brown’s return, said Jeffrey Sloman, a Miami criminal defense attorney who served briefly as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. This is usually accomplished through a federal charge brought forward if a person is avoiding prosecution. If a person remains a fugitive, they may not be granted bond to get out of jail, or a judge could be more harsh in their confinement, Sloman said. The attorney said to look no further than his client Ohad Fisherman, who was on his honeymoon in Japan but returned quickly to address the criminal charge against him. Fisherman — who was entangled in one of the cases brought by the state against the Alexander brothers — had a sex crime charge against him dropped on Monday by state prosecutors.READ MORE: Alexander brothers’ friend cleared in sex case — tearful, angry at state prosecutors“It’s in [Brown’s] best interest to come back immediately, so hopefully the judge would give him a reasonable bond so he can fight the charges out of jail,” Sloman said. “It’s very difficult to fight a case in jail. If Mr. Brown continues to avoid prosecution, eventually he will travel somewhere or to some place and he will be arrested.”Padilla told the Herald police likely believe that Brown will return to South Florida because he has property and children in the area. Formally extraditing Brown, he said, would be costly.

Daniel A. Varela dvarela@miamiherald.com “It’s not easy for the FBI to be dragging people from the Middle East,” Padilla said. “There’ll be a point that if this continues, it could manifest into something larger.”Brown should contact an attorney to turn himself in, Padilla said, because a judge could factor in the amount of time he was abroad after the warrant was signed when deciding his bond. “This is a serious crime. This isn’t going to go away,” Padilla said. “...He’s going to have to face these charges.” Grethel Aguila Miami Herald Go to X Email this person Grethel covers courts and the criminal justice system for the Miami Herald.

He was the father of two children. The driver was arrested Tuesday, July 8, 2025. GoFundMe Andres Roberto Fiallos Estupiñan, accused of running down and killing a father who was jogging in his Shenandoah neighborhood, was booked into jail Tuesday after he was released from Jackson Memorial Hospital, where police had to Taser him to subdue him, his attorney said.Fiallos Estupiñan had been hospitalized since June 10 after suffering a broken ankle while fleeing the scene of the fatal hit-and-run at Southwest 21st Avenue and 18th Street. Residents tackled him near Shenandoah Park after they say he struck 50-year-old jogger Andrew Loretta with a Volkswagen Jetta, then careened into an ice cream truck and several other vehicles before attempting to run away.Jail records show that Fiallos Estupiñan, 36, was hit with multiple charges, including leaving the scene of the crash involving death, leaving the scene of a crash with serious bodily injury, reckless driving and vehicular homicide. READ MORE: Suspect in Miami hit-and-run unconscious for weeks after hospital clash with copsPsychotic episode caused the tragedy, attorney saysFiallos Estupiñan was hospitalized for weeks and listed in critical condition, leaving his family and attorney reeling with questions on how his condition deteriorated when he went in for a broken ankle. His attorney, Bradley Horenstein, said Fiallos Estupiñan — who has a history of mental health issues — had a psychotic episode that started before the crash.“This unimaginably tragic case is the result of Mr. Fiallos Estupiñan having suffered a psychotic break, which the hospital spent weeks successfully treating with medication,” Horenstein told the Miami Herald Wednesday.According to Horenstein, Fiallos Estupiñan became agitated while handcuffed to a hospital bed and attempted to get up and leave. A Miami police officer stationed at his bedside Tasered Fiallos Estupiñan multiple times to subdue him. When that had little effect, hospital staff gave him ketamine, an anesthetic used for surgery, and Estupinan was intubated for his safety. A psychiatric evaluation conducted at the hospital provided further detail on the severity of Fiallos Estupiñan’s condition. According to the five-page report, he ripped out his IV line, jumped out of bed naked while handcuffed and set off a hospital alarm after throwing himself against a wall vent.Horenstein said doctors continued to sedate him as he was not responding to medications for the psychosis. Further, Fiallos Estupiñan developed pneumonia and a bacterial infection in his lungs, which landed him in critical condition and the Intensive Care Unit. Andres Roberto Fiallo Estupinan, accused of the hit-and-run death of a Shenandoah father out for a jog on June 10, was jailed Tuesday, July 8, 2025. He’s facing a slew of charges. Estupinan family photo For three weeks, Horenstein was unable to speak to his client due to the heavy sedation.At one point, doctors performed a tracheotomy to avoid long-term damage to his vocal cords from prolonged intubation. Horenstein noted the situation was so dire that his client’s mother was granted a humanitarian visa to fly to the U.S. and sit by his bedside.“The hospital and the City of Miami Police Department were very accommodating,” Horenstein said.Fiallos Estupiñan was slowly weaned off the sedatives as the anti-psychotic medication began to take effect; he is now lucid and calm, Horenstein said.Set to be released on conditionsFiallos Estupiñan appeared in Miami-Dade Bond Court on Wednesday before Judge Gisela Cardonne Ely in an orange jumpsuit with a visible cast on his leg. At the hearing, prosecutors said Fiallos Estupiñan was driving 75 miles per hour in a 25-mph residential zone at the time of the crash. They argued he is both a danger to the community and a flight risk.Prosecutors requested Fiallos Estupiñan’s total bond be set at no less than $100,000 and that if released, he be placed on house arrest, be barred from driving and have his passport confiscated.Horenstein pushed back, telling the judge his client is not a danger to himself or others, but made no arguments on the $100,000 bond. He noted that Fiallos Estupiñan had been hospitalized for nearly a month after the crash and is a commercial engineer by profession. His mother and sister were present in the courtroom.The judge set bond at $25,000 for each charge, for a total of $100,000. She also ordered Fiallos Estupiñan to be placed on Level 2 house arrest, meaning he can only leave home for work, church or meetings with his lawyer.Fiallos Estupiñan, who was born in Ecuador and lived in Chile, was also ordered to surrender his passport before being released from jail. Horenstein said the passport was believed to be inside Estupinan’s car, which has been impounded as evidence by the Miami Police Department.Despite that, Judge Cardonne Ely said the passport must be turned over before Estupinan could walk out of jail. Prosecutors asked Horenstein to provide proof the passport was not in his client’s possession. The judge removed the passport confiscation condition after Horenstein said he confirmed with the Miami Police sergeant supervising the case that the passport was in their possession.Witnesses held him downAccording to his arrest affidavit, Fiallos Estupiñan was driving a gray 2012 Volkswagen Passat on June 10 at a “high rate of speed” southbound on Southwest 21st Avenue near 17th Street just before 7 p.m. Police say he had an expired Florida driver’s license.At the same time, Andrew Loretta, 50, was jogging along the west side of 21st Avenue, heading toward 18th Street.Surveillance footage shows Fiallos Estupiñan striking the jogger from behind with such force that Loretta was thrown into the air and both of his legs were severed.After hitting Loretta, Fiallos Estupiñan crashed into a white 2013 Nissan ice cream van that was stopped at 21st Avenue and 18th Street, serving children at Shenandoah Park. Police say Estupinan made no “visible attempt to brake” before the impact.The Volkswagen then struck two more parked vehicles: a gray 2019 Toyota and a white 2023 Mercedes SUV, both on the west side of 21st Avenue near the park.Two witnesses told police that Fiallos Estupiñan immediately got out of the car and ran away without trying to help the injured jogger or calling 911. He ran into Shenandoah Park, where several bystanders stopped him and held him down until officers arrived.Loretta was pronounced dead at the scene. Estupinan had a broken ankle, while a passenger in one of the hit cars had a skull fracture.A beloved community memberIn Miami’s Shenandoah neighborhood, just off Coral Way, the sudden death of Loretta—a married telecommunications executive and father of two teenagers—has left his family heartbroken and the community in shock. Friends and relatives described him as an avid jogger and soccer enthusiast who moved to Miami from California in 2000. He was fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.A GoFundMe page to support Andrew’s family has raised over $193,000 with just over 900 donations.“I hope that justice is served. Not only for Andy, but for the family ... At the end of the day [Andres] has to deal with his own karma. I honestly feel a lot of compassion for him. It’s just a terrible situation,” John Loretta, Andrew’s cousin, who lives in Kendall, said.The Loretta family, including his wife and children, said in a statement through their attorney that they are grateful for the support they have received.“This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the Loretta family, and they remain deeply grateful for the outpouring of support from family, friends, and the community,” Raul Chacon, the family’s attorney, said in a statement to the Miami Herald. “At this point, they will have no further comment on the ongoing legal proceedings. Thank you for respecting their privacy and understanding their need to grieve in peace. “Miami Herald writer Isabel Rivera contributed to this report.This story was originally published July 9, 2025 at 4:17 PM.

Once limited to Southeast Asia, the criminal model is spreading — and uses AI.https://p.dw.com/p/4whWKOnline scam centers were initially concentrated in Cambodia, with additional trafficking hubs later uncovered in Laos and MyanmarImage: Kyodo News/IMAGOAdvertisementHuman trafficking-fueled scam centers have significantly expanded their operations worldwide, according to a crime trend update released on Monday by the international police agency Interpol. Hubs where trafficking victims are forced to take part in online fraud first emerged in a few Southeast Asian nations, but investigators are now also uncovering similar fraud centers in other regions. Where are scam centers spreading? According to the international police organization, victims now come from 66 countries across all continents, highlighting what Interpol describes as a global crisis involving hundreds of thousands of people. Scam centers are now increasingly found in other regions, including the Middle East, West Africa — fast emerging as a new regional hub — and Central America. Victims are often lured with fake job offers and then held captive in scam compounds. Many are blackmailed over alleged debts, beaten, sexually exploited, and in some cases tortured or raped. Inside these centers, they are forced to run online scams, mostly targeting people abroad to steal money.Freed captives describe scam operations in MyanmarTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video A 2024 Interpol-led operation exposed dozens of cases where victims were coerced into committing fraud, including a raid on an industrial-scale scam centre in the Philippines. That same year, police dismantled a centre in Namibia where 88 youths were forced to scam others. Emerging technologies are fuelling this trend further. The crime update notes a surge in the use of artificial intelligence, from generating fake job ads to creating deepfake profiles for sextortion and romance scams. Who are the victims? Interpol says the pool of those preyed upon has widened significantly. While early human trafficking victims were mainly Chinese-speaking and came from China, Malaysia, Thailand or Singapore, people are now being trafficked to such hubs from South America, East Africa and Western Europe. Tackling this rapidly globalizing threat requires a coordinated international response, said said Interpol's acting head of police services Cyril Gout. Who are the people traffickers? The report found that about 90% of human trafficking facilitators came from Asia, while 11% were from South America or Africa. About 80% of these facilitators were men, with 61% aged between 20 and 39. Online scam centers were initially concentrated in Cambodia, with additional trafficking hubs later uncovered in Laos and Myanmar. Today, similar operations have been identified in at least four more Asian countries, and evidence shows the model is spreading to other regions such as West Africa, where cyber-enabled financial crime is already common. In its findings, Interpol warned that the spread of such criminal networks needs urgent, coordinated action to disrupt trafficking routes and support victims. Interpol said that these criminal hubs are increasingly intertwined with other major transnational crimes, demanding a globally coordinated response. Trafficking routes used for scam centers are being exploited for smuggling drugs, firearms, and endangered wildlife like tigers and pangolins, Interpol said.

Here's how the death cap became the center of a chilling murder case. https://p.dw.com/p/4x8P8Even small amounts of death cap mushrooms are lethal if consumed.Image: Hans Reinhard/Okapia/picture-allianceAdvertisementA jury in Australia has found Erin Patterson guilty on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder. The murder weapon: Toxic mushrooms. Prosecutors argued Patterson intentionally served four of her family members with meal portions containing toxic death cap mushrooms in 2023. Patterson denied being guilty, originally telling police she had used store-bought mushrooms from a supermarket, then an Asian grocer in Melbourne. A search of such stores found no evidence that poisonous mushrooms had ever been sold. During the trial, Patterson said she may have foraged for the mushrooms but could not say for certain where she had obtained the death caps. Why are death cap mushrooms so deadly? Deadly by name and by nature, death cap mushrooms (Amanita phalloides) are full of a highly stable toxin called alpha-Amanitin. The toxin is so stable that it won't break down when exposed to heat in cooking. When a death cap is eaten, people don’t usually feel symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea until at least 6 hours later. During this time the alpha-Amanitin toxins are making their way through the bloodstream into organs of the body. The toxin primarily acts in the liver, where it causes cells in the liver to die. Alpha-Amanitin binds with RNA polymerase-II enzymes, preventing the cells from creating new proteins. Eventually, the liver starts to shut down. Death can occur within 24 hours. Careful identification required The Amanita genus of fungi is well-known for their toxic properties. This group include the fairytale toadstool commonly known as the fly agaric, death caps, and destroying angels . But some other Amanita mushrooms are edible. Most cases of death cap poisoning are often a case of misidentification — their classic white appearance and domed cap looks like many other types of fungi. Identification of mushrooms requires a knowledge of different parts of the anatomy: the cap or fruiting body, the gills or spores beneath the cap, and the stipe — or stalk. While death caps look like many other mushrooms, one defining characteristic is their bad smell. They don't store well at all, unless you dehydrate them. They quickly go very stinky and very nasty, Brett Summerell, a fungi expert and Chief Scientist at the Botanic Gardens of Sydney, Australia, told DW. Because of the risk of misidentification by amateurs, it's usually recommended that foragers go for edible species that cannot be mistaken. Of course, foraging under the supervision of a trained mycologist — a fungi scientist — is usually a safe option. The famous red and white toadstool is a member of the Amanita genus, and a cousin of other deadly mushroom species.Image: FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP No death caps in the supermarket The jury ultimately didn’t find Patterson’s defense — that she mixed up foraged mushrooms in the same container as store-bought ones — believable. The prosecution argued Patterson knowingly put the toxic mushrooms in the home-cooked lunch and disposed of evidence. Summerell said the likelihood that death caps could get into store-bought products is, to be honest, farcical. The reason? Death caps only grow next to oak and beech trees. Death caps, like many fungi, are mycorrhizal, meaning they have a symbiotic relationship with the tree species. Death caps obtain their nutrients from nearby tree roots and return nutrients to the nearby soil. But because they can only grow at the base of oak and beech trees, it means there's no chance of them sprouting in a commercial setting, where spores are cultivated in highly controlled conditions — and with no trees in sight. Australia could get rid of death caps Death caps aren’t native to Australia, and neither are the oak and beech trees that support them. The trees were first introduced into Australia from Europe in the 19th ecntury, and death caps in the 1960s. Summerell and other mycologists are now discussing the possibility of removing oak trees in some parts of Australia. We have argued that, in Sydney, if it's at all possible, we should start to think about removing oak trees from some of these suburbs just from the point of view of a public health risk, said Summerell. Removing introduced oaks could harbor positive benefits, both from a public health perspective by removing the risk of the top cause of mushroom poisoning, as well as providing more space for native Australian plant life.

But some criminologists doubt the figures.https://p.dw.com/p/4wuVjShoplifting is on the rise, say retailersImage: Carsten Milbret/imageBROKER/picture allianceAdvertisementGermany has never had more shoplifters than in 2024. An annual survey of 98 retailers estimates a 3% increase on the year before — amounting to some €4.95 billion ($5.84 billion) in losses. The latest study by Germany's Retail Institute (EHI) on inventory differences shows that the vast majority of those losses (€4.2 billion) was down to theft from customers, employees, or delivery workers, the EHI said, which would mean losses of some €570 million to the public purse through lost sales tax. The EHI also said that retailers had to resort to balancing out their losses and the costs of extra security by increasing prices. Study author Frank Horst calculated that some 1.5% of prices in stores could now be attributed to covering theft and security. Shoplifting techniques The EHI said there had also been a 5% increase in organized shoplifting, which accounted for a third of the total shoplifting losses. Horst said this could be individual thieves working their way through a shopping list, or else, the thefts could be carried out by coordinated groups. One of them drives a vehicle, one of them distracts the staff, or shields the one putting the goods away so they can't be seen, Horst told DW. Sometimes so-called depots are set up in the store, where all the goods are packed in a bag, and then someone else carries it out in a surreptitious moment. The survey does not include exact breakdowns of the kinds of articles that get stolen, but Horst says that thieves often target anything small, expensive, and that can be easily re-sold, such as perfume and cosmetics. There had also been a rise in the theft of foods, especially relatively expensive things like meats and cheeses. But Nicole Bögelein, a criminologist at Cologne University, cast doubt on how useful the study actually is. She told DW that the researchers estimate that 98% of cases aren't even discovered. So it's just an assumption that the majority of these losses can be attributed to theft, she said. Bögelein also cast doubt on the EHI's conclusion that there are more organized shoplifting gangs, as that could simply be because store detectives are more on the lookout for such groups. 'Poverty crimes' Despite its shortcomings, the annual EHI survey is one of the few shoplifting studies there are, and it is focused mostly on the economic impact. Bögelein, by training a sociologist as well as a criminologist, has a different perspective and says that almost all cases of shoplifting are so-called poverty crimes — defined as crimes that don't cost any money to carry out, and are committed by people because they have no money. Bögelein's own investigations into shoplifting have found that the people who are caught are often poor — possibly, she says, also because store detectives are more likely to keep an eye on people who look poor. Official statistics suggest that the majority of thefts from shops are relatively petty. According to German federal police statistics, in 66.7% of discovered and prosecuted thefts, the value of the items stolen was under €50 and in 40.2% of cases even under €15. The punishment is usually a small fine, or, if the fine can't or won't be paid, a prison sentence. Germany a 'paradise' for shoplifters? Horst described Germany as a paradise for shoplifters, as the punishments are often relatively mild. Though theoretically thieves can be imprisoned for up to five years, he said that in practice first-time offenders are often not charged at all. Bögelein said that deterrence might have an effect on some minor thefts, but was generally skeptical of the idea that more punishment discourages petty crime. People don't not steal because they're scared of punishment, she argued. In criminology, we find that people stick to rules because they think those rules are correct and because they fear a bad conscience if they don't stick to them. Public transport operators in Germany often charge people a fee for riding without a ticket, but may also press charges, especially for repeat offenders.Image: picture-alliance/dpa/J. Wolf Should shoplifting be decriminalized in Germany? There has been a debate among German criminologists about to what extent poverty crimes should be decriminalized altogether, on the grounds that such crimes are usually victimless and therefore don't require criminal justice. There have long been calls to downgrade one classic poverty crime — riding public transport without a ticket — to a misdemeanor, partly because punishing it has become a burden to public coffers and is clogging up the justice system. Between 8,000 and 9,000 people end up in prison in Germany every year for riding without a ticket. But Horst argued that shoplifting shouldn't always be defined as a poverty crime: The EHI estimates that two-thirds of shoplifting cases were what he called opportunistic perpetrators, and many of them are not necessarily poor. Horst does think that inflation and higher prices for basic items may be playing a role in the rise of shoplifting, but he was reluctant to accept that poverty was the driving element of all theft. It could be a protest theft, because people are saying they're not prepared to accept the price rises for a particular product, he said, I'm sure poverty is a part of it, but that it explains the rise on its own — I don't see that.

The punishment is usually a small fine, or, if the fine can't or won't be paid, a prison sentence. Germany a 'paradise' for shoplifters? Horst described Germany as a paradise for shoplifters, as the punishments are often relatively mild. Though theoretically thieves can be imprisoned for up to five years, he said that in practice first-time offenders are often not charged at all. Bögelein said that deterrence might have an effect on some minor thefts, but was generally skeptical of the idea that more punishment discourages petty crime. People don't not steal because they're scared of punishment, she argued. In criminology, we find that people stick to rules because they think those rules are correct and because they fear a bad conscience if they don't stick to them. Public transport operators in Germany often charge people a fee for riding without a ticket, but may also press charges, especially for repeat offenders.Image: picture-alliance/dpa/J. Wolf Should shoplifting be decriminalized in Germany? There has been a debate among German criminologists about to what extent poverty crimes should be decriminalized altogether, on the grounds that such crimes are usually victimless and therefore don't require criminal justice. There have long been calls to downgrade one classic poverty crime — riding public transport without a ticket — to a misdemeanor, partly because punishing it has become a burden to public coffers and is clogging up the justice system. Between 8,000 and 9,000 people end up in prison in Germany every year for riding without a ticket. But Horst argued that shoplifting shouldn't always be defined as a poverty crime: The EHI estimates that two-thirds of shoplifting cases were what he called opportunistic perpetrators, and many of them are not necessarily poor. Horst does think that inflation and higher prices for basic items may be playing a role in the rise of shoplifting, but he was reluctant to accept that poverty was the driving element of all theft. It could be a protest theft, because people are saying they're not prepared to accept the price rises for a particular product, he said, I'm sure poverty is a part of it, but that it explains the rise on its own — I don't see that.

Why is there a market for her content in the Balkan country and how are some Bulgarians fighting it?https://p.dw.com/p/4vrvKOn her social media profiles, Bulgarian influencer Zornitsa Gyutsova posts misogynistic advice about how men should 'deal with' womenImage: Zgyutsova/TikTokAdvertisement Women love men who can be violent if need be. That's why they like men who hit them, Bulgarian influencer Zornitsa Gyutsova tells her followers. Gyutsova suggests that not only do women prefer men who physically assault them, but that this is also the way men should behave because a woman should respect a man's physical power since she is unable to comprehend his intellectual power. This is the kind of advice that can be found on Gyutsova's social media profiles and in a private group founded by her on Telegram called Upstanding Man. 'Equality is contrary to human nature' Zornitsa Gyutsova offers her followers private chats over video where she teaches them how to deal with women — for a fee, of course. Many influencers, life coaches and other online personalities in Bulgaria and elsewhere offer private sessions or courses. What makes Gyutsova's content stand out from the rest is that its sole purpose is to explain to men that they need to learn to control their partners both psychologically and, if necessary, physically.There have been numerous protests against violence against women in Bulgaria in recent years, such as this one in 2023Image: Alexandar Detev/DW In Gyutsova's view, men in general have been treated badly by women, and women are the ones who exert violence on men, namely by not paying them enough respect. The idea of equality is like a worm in people's brains that insists men and women should be partners […] which is so contrary to human nature that it can never work, Gyutsova declared in a long video about her work that was broadcast on Bulgarian National Television. Although the broadcaster, which is partly financed by taxpayer's money, has since removed the video from its platforms, it has never publicly commented on the case. Huge backlash Gyutsova's profiles on social media have been gaining traction for several years now. Screenshots and videos from her private Telegram group chat recently surfaced on social media, triggering a huge backlash in Bulgaria. Local woman Petya Krasteva was so appalled by Gyutsova's online content that she filed a complaint against Gyutsova with the prosecutor's office. On her social media channels, she not only encourages people to degrade women and use violence against them, she also boasts that she uses the same methods on her child and her cat, she told DW. I thought to myself: This is not only absolutely unacceptable, it's criminal. Gender discrimination not a crime in Bulgaria Many other women did the same as Krasteva, only to find out a couple of weeks later that their efforts had been in vain.Petya Krasteva was appalled by Zornitsa Gyutsova's online content and filed a complaint against her with the prosecutor's officeImage: Nikola Gyulmezov In an official reply, the prosecutor's office stated that nothing could be done because Bulgaria's criminal code does not define gender discrimination as a crime and that the issue was a matter for the Commission against Discrimination. Krasteva promptly lodged a complaint with this commission, but received another negative answer based on the same reasoning. Profiles briefly taken down Although these complaints did not lead to charges being brought against Gyutsova, the backlash did have an impact. The outcry and the fact that Gyutsova's social media accounts were reported by people who found their content abhorrent, meant that the influencer's TikTok and Instagram profiles were deactivated. They were, however, reactivated a short time later. Impunity for abusers Krasteva feels that part of the reason why content like Gyutsova's strikes a chord in Bulgaria is that while patriarchal norms and domestic violence are not accepted in the country, Bulgarian society often turns a blind eye to them. The other huge problem, she says, is that as with many other social issues, there is a complete lack of consequences for the perpetrators. Valentina Dimitrova, a psychologist who works for the Emprove Foundation, a Bulgarian organization that supports women who have suffered domestic violence, holds a similar view.Psychologist Valentina Dimitrova says that content like Gyutsova's is dangerous because 'it can truly cost a human life'Image: Venera Velkovska Sadly it's embedded in the Bulgarian mindset that we often just accept that things are bad and we do nothing about it, says Dimitrova. She believes that this is also why many women stay in violent relationships: They simply have no faith in the authorities because time and time again, men who beat or even kill their partners face no legal consequences. Although some people seem to think that social media content is less problematic than actual abuse in real life, Dimitrova stresses the dangers associated with such content: It can truly cost a human life. A global online problem Misogynistic online content that paints women as lesser human beings and men as oppressed by women is not unique to Bulgaria. Such content has been growing and spreading all over the world in recent years. Influencers like Andrew Tate, who faces charges of rape, bodily harm, human trafficking and more, have created a whole movement around this sort of content. Gyutsova fits neatly into this category of influencer, but what makes her different is that she is a woman. What role does feminism play? Dimitrova thinks one issue here is that feminism is often misunderstood. Feminism does not entail men being suppressed and women controlling them. It means that women can have equal rights and can function as equals to men not only in society but also in their personal relationships, she says. Dimitrova also believes that the patriarchal notion that men should not be allowed to express emotions is highly problematic. This is reflected in Gyutsova's content, which suggests that men are weak and not manly if they dare to express their fears, emotions or feelings.People in Sofia attend a protest against domestic violence and violence against women in Bulgaria in 2023 after a young woman was stabbed by her ex-partner Image: Alexandar Detev/DW It's a vicious circle: Men who are not allowed to express any sort of emotion for fear of being labeled weak don't know what to do when they experience something frustrating in their relationships and so they resort to aggression, says Dimitrova. What can be done? Dimitrova suggests that first and foremost, men should receive support and their concerns should not just be swept under the carpet. She stresses, however, that this support should not validate the inclination to deal with problems by exerting psychological or physical violence on women. Although the Emprove Foundation focuses primarily on women's rights and issues, it does have a project that focuses on men's mental health — something the foundation says is incredibly important in the fight against gender-based violence. Men should be encouraged to connect to a healthy understanding of themselves, so they can build healthy relationships as well, says Dimitrova. Petya Krasteva firmly believes that even though authorities in Bulgaria rarely provide the support needed in cases like this, society should not remain indifferent. We should be as loud as possible when something like this turns up, she says. We should be perfectly clear that it is unacceptable. That way, other people who come across this content will know that this is not something that society approves of, and that could help them realize that they shouldn't have anything to do with it. Dimitrova agrees. We will keep talking about it [this kind of content], calling it out and not tolerating it until the authorities wake up.

Why did an Argentinian court ordered an international warrant for her arrest?https://p.dw.com/p/4uJX3Aung San Suu Kyi has been imprisoned by the Myanmar military since 2021 (archive picture from 2012)Image: Loviny Christophe/ABACA/picture alliance AdvertisementIt is rare for an international arrest warrant to be issued against a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and political prisoner whose release is demanded by both the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council. However, this is precisely what occurred in February this year, when an Argentinian court asked for the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi. The court's decision applies to 25 Myanmar citizens wanted on charges linked to genocide and crimes against humanity. The list includes not only Myanmar's military leader Min Aung Hlaing, but also former State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and former President Htin Kyaw. Suu Kyi effectively served as Myanmar's top civilian leader before the military staged a coup in February 2021. She has been imprisoned ever since. The court in Argentina claims it has the jurisdiction to order a warrant for Suu Kyi's arrest based on a legal principle that some serious crimes can be prosecuted regardless of where they were committed. The specific case focuses on discrimination against Myanmar's Rohingya ethnic minority. The Muslim Rohingya live predominantly in the western state of Rakhine, and their status as citizens and as an ethnic group recognized by the state of Myanmar has been disputed for decades. The Rohingya crisis of 2017 Since 1988, Myanmar has seen an ongoing political conflict between the military and military-backed parties on one side and Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, on the other. In 2016, after many years of stalemate, the military and Aung San Suu Kyi reached a truce. A kind of dual government was established, with Aung San Suu Kyi heading the civilian branch and Min Aung Hlaing heading the military, which had constitutionally secured independence and far-reaching political rights. On October 9, 2016, Rohingya insurgents attacked several border and police posts of the Myanmar security forces. In August 2017, the security forces launched so-called clearance operations. As a result, thousands of Rohingya were killed and around 700,000 fled to neighboring Bangladesh, with exact figures still unclear due to the nature of the ethnically-charged conflict. Rohingya refugees fear increased hardship due to aid cutsTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video While the military denied using excessive force, international watchdogs and the UN agree that Myanmar's actions against the Rohingya constitute grave human rights violations. Still, two questions remain: First, did the offensive amount to genocide? Second, how much of it was the responsibility of Aung San Suu Kyi? The question of genocide Concerns that a genocide was happening in Myanmar have already been voiced before 2017. In 2015, the human rights organization Fortify Rights published a report with the Allard K. Lovenstein International Human Rights Clinic from Yale Law School in which was stated that there is strong evidence that genocide is being committed against Rohingya. Those voices only grew louder after 2017, and in November 2019, Gambia initiated a case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Myanmar, claiming violations of the UN's Genocide Convention. The ICJ has yet to rule on the case, however, meaning that the existence of genocide remains unconfirmed in a legal sense. But for human rights organizations like Fortify Rights, the Burmese-Rohingya Organization UK (BROUK) and the former UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar, Tomas Ojea Quintana, there is no doubt that genocide did take place. Quintana, an Argentinian, told Radio Free Asia that the court in his native country understood what was at stake, which is the genocide against the Rohingya people. The question of responsibility Aung San Suu Kyi was a globally renowned human rights advocate since the early 1990s until the events of 2017. She was also heading Myanmar's civilian government during the deadly wave of violence against the Rohingya. As chief councilor, she was notably hesitant to speak out against the military and even went to The Hague in 2019 to defend Myanmar at the International Court of Justice. She denied genocide was happening in Rakhine but admitted human rights violations, which would be investigated by Myanmar. She later confirmed this position in an interview with the Financial Times. War crimes were committed during the internal armed conflict with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army by members of Myanmar's security forces and civilians, she told the paper. At the same time, Aung San Suu Kyi pointed to a report by the Independent Commission of Enquiry (ICOE) which was set up by Myanmar without Rohingya representatives. The ICOE found no evidence of genocide, she told the paper, despite its report recording killing of civilians, disproportionate use of force, looting of property, and destruction of abandoned homes of Muslims. For those who believe Myanmar troops committed genocide against the Rohingya, Aung San Suu Kyi's refusal to recognize it makes her complicit. But does her stance — admitting that human rights violations happened but not genocide — mean Aung San Suu Kyi is guilty of committing genocide? What do we know about the Argentinian court order? The reasons behind the Argentinian court's decision to seek an international arrest warrant are not fully clear, as neither the ruling nor the exact evidence on which the ruling was based are publicly available. DW contacted the Argentinian court and the Argentinian human rights commission to get more information in the matter, but received no reply. The 2021 coup triggered protests in Myanmar, which eventually escalated into a civil war.Image: Sai Aung Main/AFP In the months following the announcement, Myanmar expert and former ambassador Derek Tonkin published an academic paper on the issue, examining the sources which most likely led to the arrest warrant. He writes that the petition [on which the decision of the court seems to be based] contains much narrative and opinion which are debatable and questionable, and in some areas are simply wrong. Commenting on the claim that Aung San Suu Kyi and others validated the genocide against the Rohingya, Tonkin states, it is not true and is supported by no evidence anywhere in the petition. Tonkin also rejects the accusation that Aung San Suu Kyi was directly responsible for the events in Rakhine State during her time as state counsellor at the time. I find this totally unconvincing. The Tatmadaw [the Myanmar military] refused to accept Aung San Suu Kyi's appointment, he writes. So far, the arrest warrant hasn't had any impact. Aung San Suu Kyi seems set to celebrate her 80th birthday next month as a prisoner in Myanmar as the civil war rages on. With the passage of time, the international arrest warrant might end up as a mere footnote in a long political career filled with legal battles.

Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Mohali Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Harmandeep Singh Hans, said several special teams were constituted to trace the rising number of heinous crimes in the district. The operation was led by SP (Operations) Talwinder Singh, SP (PBI) Deepika Singh, DSP (City-2) Harsimran Singh Bal, and DSP (Economic Offences) Rajesh. Under this operation SHO Amandeep Singh and inspectors Gabbar Singh and Gagandeep carried out an investigation based on an FIR registered on July 12. According to the complainant, the incident occurred during the night of July 11–12, when she was returning from Best Tech Mall after watching a movie with her friend. Near Lakhnour turn, four bike-borne youths, dressed in Nihang attire, intercepted their car. The miscreants forcibly dragged her out of the vehicle and kidnapped her friend before fleeing the scene in the stolen car, the complaint stated. The SSP said that after assaulting the kidnapped boy, the accused threw him about 100 meters away. They then fled with the girl, kept her with them for approximately 30 minutes and later pushed her out near a gate before escaping towards Ambala. SSP Hans identified the arrested accused as Shamsher Singh, a resident of Gurdaspur; Satnam Singh (from Ludhiana), who works as a cab driver; Nirmal Singh (Nawanshahr), employed as a security guard; and Chander Mohan, alias Jaildar (Jammu), who also works as a security guard, All four were residing at a PG located behind Gurdwara Singh Shaheedan, Sohana in Mohali. Acting on a tip-off, police put the entire district on high alert. Multiple teams were deployed and after analysing the CCTV footage, the stolen vehicle was successfully traced. The accused were arrested from Chanarthal village under Sahabad police station, and the looted car was recovered. “These accused may be involved in other criminal cases as well. Interrogation is underway, and more revelations are expected,” Hans added.",7f251a7091a932c843ffae68035733e3ed5734782bce2e0aba302a91473a43d5,e9ffc2dbb5d1b5a0c5b8fd59dc708464

Sanjay Verma was shot dead on Monday at around 10 am, right outside his showroom in Abohar. According to eyewitnesses, three motorcycle-borne assailants lay in wait for him. The moment Verma stepped out of his car, they opened indiscriminate fire, killing him on the spot before fleeing the scene. While the shooters escaped and have yet to be identified, the Punjab Police announced the arrest of two of their accomplices, Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan, both residents of Patiala district, for helping the shooters escape in the car. However, within hours, both men were killed in a police encounter. This development has added fuel to the controversy. BJP General Secretary Manjinder Singh Sirsa accused the Punjab government of mishandling the law and order situation. On his visit to Chandigarh Wednesday, Sirsa said, “First of all, the Punjab government is not able to control the law and order and criminals… Punjab has become a police state. If Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has a clean image, he should get a CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) inquiry conducted into these encounters so the truth comes out.” Reacting sharply, AAP’s Punjab state president Aman Arora called the BJP’s stance “extremely shameful,” accusing it of siding with gangsters instead of supporting Verma’s bereaved family. Arora said, “While the entire Punjab stands with the family of Shri Sanjay Verma, Manjinder Singh Sirsa’s open support for gangsters today proves that the BJP is backing criminals even through central jails.” After meeting the family of Sanjay Verma on Monday, Arora had stated that gangsters lodged in jails outside Punjab were behind such heinous criminal activities. Whereas, Union Minister of State Ravneet Singh Bittu held the Mann government responsible for the ‘growing fear and lawlessness’ across Punjab. “Instead of owning up to their failure, AAP leaders are shamelessly pointing fingers at the Centre. This is not governance –it’s a complete abdication of duty,” he added. Bittu called Arora’s remarks “irresponsible” and “highly condemnable,” accusing him of trying to deflect attention from the AAP government’s failure to maintain law and order in the state. In a statement released on Monday, Bittu announced that he would write to the Governor of Punjab, urging him to take cognisance of Arora’s “baseless allegations”. He also sought written clarifications from Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav and Chief Secretary KAP Sinha, questioning whether Arora’s statement reflected the official position of the Bhagwant Mann-led government. “Aman Arora’s claim that gangster Lawrence Bishnoi is safe in Gujarat under the Centre’s protection is nothing but an excuse to hide the AAP government’s incompetence. These kinds of inflammatory and misleading remarks are both dangerous and unacceptable,” said Bittu. He reaffirmed that the central government has always taken a tough stance against terrorism and organised crime. “We conducted surgical strikes inside Pakistan when needed. Do you think gangsters are beyond our reach? Once the BJP forms government in Punjab, we’ll show what decisive action really looks like,” Bittu said. Pointing to the killing of Sanjay Verma, Bittu accused the Punjab government of completely surrendering to the gangster nexus. “Extortion threats and targeted killings have become the new normal for Punjab’s business community,” he said. Adding to the political slugfest, AAP’s Abohar constituency in-charge Arun Narang displayed a photo showing Abohar MLA Sandeep Jakhar with Shakti, a bike driver allegedly linked to the murder. Sandeep Jakhar, who is a suspended Congress MLA and nephew of Punjab BJP chief Sunil Jakhar, clarified that the picture was from the 2022 assembly election campaign. “Many people get pictures taken with us during campaigns. It’s illogical to link that picture to this crime,” he said. ‘We have full trust’ Jagat Verma, elder brother of Sanjay Verma, has expressed satisfaction over the police probe. In a video, Jagat Verma said, “We have full trust in the Punjab Police and we are satisfied with the ongoing police investigation. We humbly appeal to one and all to please stop doing politics over this issue. We appeal to the police to nab the rest of the culprits soon… We trust that we will get justice soon.” State of probe The police said their investigations have revealed that the getaway bike was driven by one Shakti, a daily wager from Azimgarh village of Abohar. While escaping, the attackers lost control of their bike and forcibly snatched another two-wheeler. They later abandoned it on Seeto Road and allegedly fled in a waiting Swift car, driven by Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan. Jaspreet Singh’s family has denied any involvement, alleging that he was picked up from his house in Mardankheri village of Patiala during the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday, and that they later received news of his death. They maintain that Jaspreet was a daily wager with no criminal background. The police said Jaspreet had a criminal background, and released a few pictures of him brandishing weapons. The details of his criminal record haven’t been revealed as of now. At the time of filing this report, the postmortem examination of Jaspreet and Ram was underway at the Abohar Civil Hospital under strict police cover. Meanwhile, gangster Aarzoo Bishnoi had claimed responsibility for the murder on social media, tagging Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar and Maharashtra’s Shivam Lonker hours after the murder. After the alleged encounter, Bishnoi again posted that the real shooters remained at large, and that Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan had no role in the killing. The Punjab unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has identified the Lawrence Bishnoi gang as the perpetrators behind this crime. The police, however, have not confirmed these claims nor provided clarity on the identities of the actual shooters.",e5f95abfc958db5d8cdbca385844d557be4c91c691308cd7d60da76720ec2964,110f9aeaaf40f7b999bac5a862114640

Their online conversations quickly grew into what seemed like a genuine relationship, and soon, talks of marriage followed. But the connection, which appeared to promise a shared future, turned out to be an elaborate cyber scam in which he was allegedly duped of a staggering Rs 1.55 crore over eight months. The investigation revealed that the cybercriminals, operating behind the profile of ‘Anamika,’ gradually gained the complainant’s trust and allegedly requested large sums of money. On the pretence of building a future together, ‘Anamika’ allegedly convinced him to transfer funds to purchase a house without ever having met. Over time, the scammers further manipulated him into investing in various trading apps, luring him with promises of exceptionally high returns, said the police. After spending nearly all his life savings and facing further demands for more money, he realised he had been deceived. When he tried to recover his funds, ‘Anamika’ allegedly abruptly stopped all communication with him. The police filed an FIR in March based on his complaint. The investigation by the cybercrime police station in Pimpri Chinchwad unearthed an elaborate network of mule account handlers allegedly operating from Solapur and with links to cybercriminals masterminding these scams from China. The police zeroed in on one particular mule account registered in Solapur in June. As the account holder was questioned, he spilled the beans on three others from Solapur who had allegedly told him that his bank account would be used for taking funds obtained from gaming applications. As the investigation dug deeper into these three suspects, the police established their identities and roles in the racket. The mule account handlers from Solapur have been identified as Shubham Chandrakant Mantha, 25, a resident of Ashok Chowk; Swapnil Chandulal Baheti, 35, a resident of Hotgi Road; and Prashik Uttam Navghare, 26, a resident of Juna Kumbhani Naka. “Our investigation revealed that Mantha worked for a China-headquartered payment application company, and he and Baheti were in direct contact with the masterminds based out of China. A coordinated search operation was launched for the trio as their roles were confirmed in the probe,” an officer who was part of the probe said. In the second week of June, Mantha and Navghare were arrested from Pune International Airport when they were about to flee to Nepal via Patna. Baheti, too, was placed under arrest. “Investigation revealed an elaborate mule handling and fund siphoning operation with direct links to China,” said an officer. All three suspects are currently in judicial custody.",9865caa283c9b9ddd31c4f3ac55f1c88767cac6e0a52108d705b0426b1b3413e,d113295a560ee830400d4ef5003f9379

The victim, identified as Sanjeev, 19, a resident of Rajiv Colony, Panchkula, had reportedly come to the area to meet a friend when he was attacked. According to police officials, Sanjeev was surrounded by three to four individuals around 10.30 pm. He was stabbed multiple times in the chest and abdomen with a knife, and then left critically injured on the roadside. The assailants fled the scene immediately after the attack. Soon after, a crowd gathered at the spot, and the PCR was informed. Sanjeev was rushed to the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, Chandigarh, where he succumbed to his injuries during treatment, the police said. The Chandigarh Police have apprehended two minors in connection with the crime. “An FIR has been registered, and the two juveniles have been booked for murder. They will be sent to a juvenile home,” said Vijay Singh, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Chandigarh Police. Sources revealed that the accused allegedly attacked Sanjeev because he was reportedly stalking their sister. The police have not ruled out the involvement of more individuals and are continuing their investigation. Meanwhile, the preliminary postmortem report has stated that the victim died due to punctured vital organs caused by the stabbings. The incident has triggered tension in the area, with residents demanding increased police patrolling and swift justice. Teenager injured in stabbing attack in Sector 40 A 19-year-old teenager was critically injured in a targeted stabbing attack by a group of around half a dozen minors in Block C of Sector 40 in Chandigarh on Sunday night. The assault is suspected to be a result of personal enmity. According to the police, the attackers arrived on three to four motorbikes and were not wearing helmets. They attacked the youth and fled the scene within seconds. The victim was initially rushed by his family members to a private hospital in Mohali, but was later shifted to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, Chandigarh.

But when public figures cross legal lines, the consequences unfold not just in courtrooms but also under the relentless scrutiny of the public eye. One name that recently forced this uncomfortable truth into the spotlight is Sean “Diddy” Combs, the hip-hop mogul and music industry titan who, after years of whispers and lawsuits, has now been convicted in a federal court. In July 2025, a jury found Combs guilty on two felony counts of transportation to engage in prostitution under the Mann Act, a law dating back to 1910. These charges relate to the coerced travel of his former partner, singer Cassie Ventura, and another woman identified only as “Jane,” both of whom testified during the trial. Combs was acquitted on three other charges, including racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking. Still, the guilty verdict marks a seismic fall for the 55-year-old artist once synonymous with glamour, success, and cultural dominance. Diddy’s story is far from unique. Over the years, several A-listers have been convicted of crimes — from drug possession and assault to manslaughter and tax evasion. This listicle delves into 10 high-profile celebrities with criminal records, focusing only on those with confirmed legal outcomes. Once a towering figure in global music, Diddy’s legacy has been rocked by criminal convictions. In a 2025 federal trial, he was found guilty of two counts of transporting women – including ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura – for prostitution, under the Mann Act. Though acquitted of more serious charges like racketeering and sex trafficking, the felony convictions carry serious legal and reputational consequences. More fallout may follow. Attorney Tony Buzbee claims over 100 men and women have accused Diddy of rape and assault. One woman alleged she was gang raped at age 17 after being drugged at a 2003 party. While Combs’s team dismisses the lawsuits as publicity stunts, the convictions have added weight to the mounting allegations. Sanjay Dutt’s conviction remains one of the most talked-about legal sagas in Indian cinema. In 1993, following the devastating Mumbai bomb blasts, Dutt was arrested under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) for illegally possessing an AK-56 rifle, which was part of a consignment linked to the bombings. Though he was acquitted of terrorism charges, he was convicted in 2006 under the Arms Act for illegal possession of firearms. After years of legal proceedings and appeals, Dutt was sentenced to five years in prison and ultimately served over four years, including time at Yerwada Central Jail. Before becoming Tony Stark, Robert Downey Jr. was one of Hollywood’s most tragic cautionary tales. Struggling with addiction in the 90s, Downey was repeatedly arrested for possession of heroin, cocaine, and unlicensed firearms. He was famously found wandering into a neighbour’s house under the influence and passed out in their bed. In 1999, after multiple probation violations, he was sentenced to three years in prison, though he served roughly a year before early release. In 2009, Bollywood actor Shiney Ahuja was arrested for raping his domestic help—a case that sent shockwaves through the film industry. Though the victim later recanted her statement, the court found the original testimony credible and convicted Ahuja in 2011 under Section 376 (rape) and other charges. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, though he spent about three years in jail before being released on bail pending appeal. Wesley Snipes’ high-flying Hollywood career hit a wall when he was convicted in 2008 on three misdemeanor counts of failing to file federal income tax returns. Prosecutors claimed he hadn’t paid taxes for years, despite earning tens of millions. Though he was acquitted of the more severe felony tax fraud charges, he still served nearly three years in prison. In 1992, boxing champion Mike Tyson was convicted of raping 18-year-old Desiree Washington, a beauty pageant contestant, in an incident that took place at a hotel in Indianapolis in July 1991. The jury found Tyson guilty after about 10 hours of deliberation, rejecting his defense that the encounter was consensual. Tyson was sentenced to six years in prison and served approximately three years before being released on parole in 1995. The conviction shocked the sports world and dramatically altered Tyson’s public image overnight, marking a significant turning point in his career. Despite this setback, Tyson later returned to the boxing ring and expanded his career into entertainment, including notable acting roles such as in The Hangover film series. In 2001, Stranger Things star Winona Ryder was arrested for shoplifting over $5,500 worth of merchandise from a Beverly Hills Saks Fifth Avenue store. She was later convicted of felony grand theft and vandalism, receiving three years’ probation, 480 hours of community service, and fines. The incident damaged her career for years, leading to a hiatus from leading roles in Hollywood. Ryder eventually made a well-received comeback, and her 2000s-era troubles are now often seen as part of the conversation around mental health and celebrity pressure. Shia LaBeouf is known for his acting talent as well as his history of erratic behaviour and legal troubles. Over the years, he has been arrested multiple times for offenses such as disorderly conduct, public intoxication, and drunk driving. One of the most notable incidents occurred in 2017, when LaBeouf was arrested in Savannah, Georgia, for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. During this arrest, he was caught on camera making a racially charged outburst toward police officers. These incidents, along with other arrests for similar behavior, have contributed to his reputation for instability. LaBeouf has also faced civil lawsuits from former partners, most prominently from singer FKA Twigs, who accused him of sexual battery and emotional abuse. While he has not been criminally convicted in these civil cases, the combination of his legal issues and public controversies has overshadowed his career achievements, leading many to view him as a cautionary example of wasted potential in Hollywood. Before becoming a blockbuster actor and producer, Mark Wahlberg had a violent and troubling past. At 16, Wahlberg was charged with attempted murder after assaulting two Vietnamese men during a racially motivated attack. He was convicted of assault and served 45 days in prison. The case drew renewed attention in 2014 when Wahlberg applied for a pardon, sparking criticism from civil rights groups and raising questions about accountability and privilege. Wahlberg has publicly acknowledged his past and expressed remorse, though his request for a pardon was ultimately dropped. Phil Spector, the music genius behind the Wall of Sound, became infamous for a far more sinister reason. In 2009, he was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2003 death of actress Lana Clarkson, who was found shot in his mansion. The trial, his second, after a hung jury, ended in a conviction and a 19-years-to-life prison sentence. Spector died in custody in 2021.",73697cd66a0be055d4dc8648c5cf018f30e228abbd24ff6c1604b1ab6fa4aac5,1676ed0148c17932b20d45559413e540

The doctor received two bullet injuries, and his condition is critical, they said. Ajay Gandhi, Senior Superintendent of Police, Moga, said Dr Aniljit Kamboj, who is in his fifties, was shot at by two men who came to his Harbans Nursing Home at around 2 pm. “The doctor was treating one of them, and discussing medicines when the second man who was standing behind opened fire. Two bullets hit the doctor, including one in the chest. He has been admitted to a private hospital in Moga, and his condition is critical. He is on ventilator,” Gandhi told The Indian Express. He said the police are probing the case from all angles, and checking CCTV footage to identify the suspects. A family member told The Indian Express that Kamboj had received extortion calls from Canada-based designated terrorist Lakhbir Singh Landa, an operative of the banned organization Babbar Khalsa International (BKI). The threat calls were being received since 2022 and the caller was demanding at least Rs 1 crore, said the family member, requesting anonymity. He further said that Kamboj was also given a security cover by the Moga Police but the lone gunman was withdrawn some months ago. Moga SP (investigation) Bal Krishan Singla, said: “An FIR was registered in 2022 after Dr Kamboj had received threat calls. Landa was nominated as an accused in that FIR. However, the family did not inform us about any such latest incident.” Asked if the security cover was withdrawn, he said: “They were having the security cover till some time ago but currently, they had no such threat perception.

The deceased have been identified as dhaba owner Siddarodh Tugudi, 35, his nephew Jagadish Belamagi, 28, and employee Ramanna Bhosga, 40. The police said that the triple murders were in retaliation to a killing that occurred in November last year in connection with a feud between two families who belong to the same village. According to the police, Tugudi and his brothers had murdered a criminal identified as Somu Talikoti over a financial dispute and were released on bail recently. To avenge Talikot’s death, four of his brothers along with associates reportedly orchestrated Wednesday’s attack, the police said. “The police have been warning the families after the murder that took place last year. They belong to the same caste and are relatives. We suspect that these murders were carried out in revenge,” said Kalaburagi City Police Commissioner Sharanappa S D on Thursday. The assailants allegedly stormed the dhaba at 12.45 am, targeting Siddarodh and Jagadish, the police said, adding that they have recovered crucial CCTV footage from a nearby petrol station. The accused had damaged the CCTVs installed at the dhaba. “When the dhaba employees attempted to flee through the back door toward an agricultural field, the attackers pursued them.

The accused were riding a motorcycle with a temporary number plate when they were intercepted by the police. Police said that the arrests are linked to the firing incident that took place on the intervening night of June 20-21.

The accused — Sandeep Jawahar Shah, a resident of Solapur, and Salim Khubbuddin Patel, a resident of Navi Mumbai — were arrested in Mumbai and Sangli earlier this month. As per the CBI, it discovered that the two were involved in duping NEET candidates and their parents by falsely claiming to have connections with officials of the National Testing Agency (NTA) that conducts the examination. As per the CBI, Shah initially demanded Rs 90 lakh from each candidate and agreed to accept Rs 87.5 lakh per candidate. The central agency claimed that Shah and Patel would assure candidates that they would receive details of their purportedly increased marks six hours before the official declaration of results. The accused sought to be released on bail on the grounds that probe was completed and their custodial interrogation was not required. The pleas claimed that there was no recovery at the instance of the applicants and they’ll co-operate with the trial after being released on bail. The CBI, however, opposed the pleas stating that the same be rejected as there other accused persons are yet to be arrested and therefore the custodial interrogation of present applicants would be required. However, special judge VP Desai observed that till date (on June 21) “the investigating officer has nothing concrete to show that till what period the other accused will be arrested”. Merely because the other accused persons are yet to be arrested cannot be a ground for rejection of the bail, the judge added. The court further noted that offence under section 7(A) of Prevention of the Corruption (PC) Act is not punishable in imprisonment of life or death and punishment prescribed is not less than three years but will extend to seven years. “Nothing is brought on record against the applicant that he will not be available for trial. Hence discretion in the nature of bail can be exercised in the favour of applicants,” the court held and granted bail to the two on furnishing personal bond of Rs 50,000 each along with other terms and conditions.",4974f52e05170329fc61b34918e72435efd9c5cfb80bb908d716d1ecea37e141,772d6209c825a13e8bd82758db7362e1

From education and healthcare to agriculture and criminal justice, governments around the world, including India, are using AI-based technologies with the claim of improving governance, efficiency and transparency. The purpose of technology, ideally, is to improve human life. But an important question remains: Who controls this technology? History reminds us that technological advancement does not automatically translate into better socio-economic conditions. For instance, when the steam engine was invented in the 18th century, it sparked a massive increase in industrial productivity. Logically, this should have reduced working hours and given people more leisure time. On the contrary, working conditions for labourers worsened. This contradiction occurred because the benefits of technology are controlled by the corporate class, who use it to extract labour without improving the workers’ well-being. The same pattern could repeat itself with AI, if we fail to examine “who” shapes and benefits from its development. AI and society: Shaped by bias AI in its current form reflects existing social biases — caste, gender, religion, skin colour, language, and region. A 2019 Guardian report found women are 47 per cent more likely to be seriously injured and 17 per cent more likely to die in car crashes, as cars and their safety systems are designed for male bodies. Sociologists Donald MacKenzie and Judy Wajcman introduced the concept of the “social shaping of technology (SST)” in the 1980s. The SST argues that technology is not neutral. It is influenced by the social, political, and economic environments in which it is developed. A 2018 MIT study found facial recognition systems had a 0.8 per cent error rate for White men, but 34.7 per cent for dark-skinned women. UN Women warns AI can amplify stereotypes across areas like hiring and healthcare. Studies show AI is not neutral and biased data harms marginalised groups. In criminal justice, this could trigger serious human rights issues. Who represents India’s database? In India, there is no specific legal framework to regulate the use of AI. Yet tools are being widely adopted by both government and private institutions. Large language models and generative AI systems operate on existing datasets, but these datasets themselves are shaped by unequal access. The CSDS 2019 report pointed out a deep digital divide in India. A significant part of the population, especially women, Dalits, Adivasis, minorities, and rural communities — has limited or no access to the Internet. Oxfam’s India Inequality Report 2022 found that women use the Internet 33 per cent less than men. Only 31 per cent of rural Indians are online, compared to 67 per cent in urban areas. The situation is even more skewed when it comes to caste, with “upper” caste people having far more representation in digital spaces than Dalits and Adivasis. This means that the data on which AI systems in India are trained does not fairly represent the country’s social reality. As a result, AI tools built on such biased datasets risk reinforcing existing inequalities. AI in criminal justice: A threat to the marginalised? The NCRB’s Prison Statistics 2018 reveals deep inequalities in India’s justice system: Two-thirds of prisoners are Dalits, Adivasis, or OBCs, 19 per cent are Muslim, and 66 per cent are illiterate or have not studied beyond class X. NCRB 2015 data shows over 55 per cent of undertrials come from Dalit, Adivasi, or Muslim backgrounds. This raises concerns about using AI in criminal justice, as biased data can reinforce existing discrimination. Recent examples highlight these risks. The Punjab and Haryana High Court used ChatGPT in a bail rejection for a murder case, setting a troubling precedent. Amazon’s 2014 AI hiring tool, scrapped for bias against women, shows how AI can replicate past injustices. In India, where power in government, corporates, and media is concentrated among the privileged, AI in recruitment and policing without ethical safeguards could further marginalise vulnerable communities. Experts often argue that developed countries possess more advanced AI systems to control crime, whereas developing nations lack the tangible and human resources needed to use such technologies effectively. However, even in the United States, AI-driven systems have demonstrated significant flaws. For instance, the COMPAS algorithm used in the criminal justice system has been shown to be twice as likely to assign higher risk scores to Black defendants compared to White defendants charged with similar offenses. Similarly, the NAACP has raised concerns on the Chicago crime prediction algorithm and its inherent systemic bias against Black communities. These examples highlight the misuse of AI-based technologies that disproportionately affect marginalised groups and violate their human rights. The central government in India is increasingly deploying tech-based tools in the criminal justice system. Notable initiatives include the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS), a nationwide database of crimes and offenders; the Inter-operable Criminal Justice System (ICJS), which enables information sharing among various state institutions; and the National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS), designed to assist in identifying suspects and missing persons. However, the use of such systems in the absence of a well-defined legal and regulatory framework raises concerns. These measures may reinforce systemic bias and lead to further marginalisation of communities that already lack adequate representation and voice within institutional records. The need for inclusive and ethical technology India holds enormous diversity but also deep inequalities. The databases currently used in AI development do not reflect the complexities of Indian society. While AI has many exciting possibilities, it also raises serious ethical and social questions that must be addressed before it is adopted widely. Therefore, the government must enact regulations to ensure AI remains inclusive, transparent, and accountable. Technology must not reinforce existing stigmas and exclusion and rather become a tool for empowerment. AI’s development should be centred around the needs of the marginalised communities to ensure equitable progress.

(ABC News) We are a group of men organised into crews — we call ourselves 'the ones who block the roads', one of the men, Mohammad Salman, told the ABC. If you want to get aid and secure food, you have to come through here; otherwise you won't eat. Today, all these people have become gangsters. They seize food from trucks and anything they find on the road. They'll take food away from anyone. If someone grabs food from a truck and I don't get my share, I'll go after him. That's how we have become. If someone gets something, I will take it from him to eat. Some people here die from stabbings and attacks — all over food. We've all turned into mafias and road blockers. Some of the men say they have worked with a gang leader named Yasser Abu Shabab.Some of the gangs looting aid have reportedly been armed and protected by Israeli authorities. (ABC News)'Uncharismatic, illiterate' gang leaderOnce a wanted criminal, it's now widely believed that Abu Shabab has been armed and protected by the Israeli government — to take control of the part of southern Gaza where his family holds sway.Abu Shabab is apparently an unlikely figure to lead a resistance against Hamas's rule in Gaza, Gazan analyst Muhammad Shehada, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in The New Arab. Police in Gaza were perplexed when he emerged as a top gang leader. The security source told The New Arab that Abu Shabab is 35 years old, thin, weak, short [around 150 centimetres tall], uncharismatic, illiterate, has strabismus in one eye, and has never received military training, he said. To them, he didn't seem like someone with the leadership skills necessary to form a group of 300 armed militants, steal truckloads of aid, and store it under the radar. The UN says Yasser Abu Shabab's gang has been raiding aid trucks with the apparent indifference or protection of the Israeli military. (Supplied: Facebook)Israeli media have reported Abu Shabab escaped from jail with Israeli assistance early in the war. He was in a Hamas prison until October 2023 for theft and drug offences, and his release came under the cover of an Israeli attack on security facilities in the Strip at the beginning of the war. From that moment on, his name emerged as someone who would fill the security vacuum in eastern Rafah, the Israeli newspaper Maariv wrote.The United Nations has identified Abu Shabab's gang as one of those raiding aid convoys when they entered Gaza, saying they were doing so with the apparent protection or indifference of the Israeli military.Former French diplomat Jean-Pierre Filliu, who spent one month in Gaza with Doctors Without Borders from December 2024 to January 2025, said he witnessed the gang being protected by the IDF while looting trucks. The Israeli military recognised its inability to promote a clan-based alternative to Hamas and decided to rely more or less openly on organised crime, he wrote in Le Monde. The key figure in this manoeuvre was a previously minor member of a Rafah family, Yasser Abu Shabab, whom Hamas had imprisoned in the past for his various trafficking activities. But Israeli protection allowed Abu Shabab to substantially expand its activities and poach, from other clans, some 100 loyalists ready for anything, often ex-convicts. What could only be called a gang operated under the eyes of the Israeli army … and it was equipped with brand-new weapons, an irrefutable indication of its collaboration with the occupiers. The Netzarim Corridor, where many of the aid gangs lurk, separates northern Gaza from the south and was cleared of buildings by the Israeli military. (Supplied via Reuters: Planet Labs Inc)Gangs taking whatever they canA gang member confirmed to the ABC that Abu Shabab's group had been stealing and selling aid. People would work normally with Yasser just like employees. He had two shifts. It was easy, the gang member said. We used to stand by the roadside to wait for trucks from Gaza to Kerem Shalom. I would take whatever I could — flour, sugar, anything we needed. The man explained that much of the looted food was then sold to merchants, although he insisted aid groups were given some of it. They would unload the goods, and traders would come to buy them. Half of the supplies were distributed to institutions like schools, he said. The aid agency would arrive to collect its share and then distribute it to schools. Abu Shabab's gang call themselves the Anti-Terror Service or the Popular Forces . (ABC News)The gang member alleged Hamas had previously been stealing some aid, something the group denies. He [Yasser] was working in security when he saw the government and Hamas members stealing from the aid trucks as they passed through central Gaza and Nuseirat, he told the ABC. That's when he decided to take action — stealing the trucks to distribute some of the aid himself, handing out money, flour … and that was it. Abu Shabab and his men, now calling themselves the Anti-Terror Service or the Popular Forces , have been accused by many Gazans of working with the Israeli government.The Israeli government has said openly it has backed groups like the one Abu Shabab runs.Hamas fighters have clashed with members of Abu Shabab's gang. (ABC News)Netanyahu arms 'clans' in GazaIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted in June that his government had activated clans in Gaza opposed to Hamas.That sparked concerns from the opposition that their weapons could eventually be turned on the IDF, or used to create unmanageable chaos. In consultation with security officials, we made use of clans in Gaza that are opposed to Hamas, he said in a video on social media. What's wrong with that? It saves the lives of IDF soldiers. The Times of Israel said Defence officials had confirmed Mr Netanyahu was referring to the Abu Shabab gang. The sources confirmed that Israel has been arming the gang with Kalashnikov rifles, including some that were seized from Hamas during the ongoing war, it wrote on June 5.Palestinians guard trucks carrying aid into the north of Gaza from the Israeli-controlled Zikim crossing.

The arrival of the new aid operation has changed conditions in the south of Gaza, but Hamas is still keen to kill or imprison Abu Shabab again.On July 2, the Hamas-controlled Interior Ministry in Gaza gave Abu Shabab 10 days to surrender himself and face trial for treason.The ABC called and sent messages to Yasser Abu Shabab but did not receive a response.Comment has also been sought from the Israeli government and the IDF.Meanwhile, the Israeli government and military continue to dismiss United Nations reports of a worsening hunger crisis in Gaza.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is only distributing food parcels at limited locations in southern and central Gaza.Israel's government last month stopped allowing food shipments into the north.The men who block the roads are still waiting by the aid routes, hoping for any chance to seize supplies and stay alive.The UN says the hunger crisis in Gaza is worsening.

Miss, he said, after the woman — assuming it was a phone number from a love struck businessman — dropped the note unread into her purse. You’d better look at that note. I have a bomb. For good measure, he opened the briefcase to show her several red cylinders, connected by a wire.Cooper wanted $US200,000 ($305,910), an amount equal to $US1,591,781 ($2,434,697) in today's currency.He wanted it in a knapsack by 5pm. He also wanted two sets of parachutes — implying he intended to take a hostage.The plane would land at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and there the money would be brought aboard, Cooper told the flight crew.Then, and only then, would the 35 passengers be free to go.A leap from a plane launches a decades-long FBI manhuntUltimately the plane circled Seattle for two hours — during that time, many passengers later told media they didn’t even know what was going on.Richard Simmons, head of a prisoner-rehabilitation program, told reporters he slept most of the time we were up there . I saw one stewardess answer a call and her face dropped, he said. She looked bewildered and gulped. I guess she learned what was happening then. His wife, Barbara, worried they may have gotten on the wrong plane. First we went right past Seattle, then Everett, she said. All I could think of was the plane was going to Vancouver and we were on the wrong flight. On the ground, the FBI and the Seattle Police Department rushed to get the money, parachutes, and emergency personnel ready for the landing.The plane landed at 5.46pm, and the money was handed over by an airport staffer — 10,000 unmarked $20 bills in a cloth bag.The passengers got off. The flight attendants retrieved the parachutes. He told them he didn’t need the instructions on how to use them.The plane took off again a few hours later with only Cooper and the flight crew aboard, followed by three fighter jets.This time it was heading for Mexico City, but the hijacker would not make it that far.The black tie DB Cooper left behind on the plane he hijacked. (Supplied: FBI)As the plane travelled somewhere between Seattle and Reno around 8pm, Cooper ordered the flight attendants to open the staircase at the back of the plane.Then he tied the bag of money around his waist, donned his parachutes, and jumped.It was the end of the hijacking, but only the beginning of an investigation that would continue for decades.Suspects, interviews and a $30,000 hoax The new files released this month are the latest in a series to be declassified under the Trump administration.The first lot of more than 400 pages were published online in March.Bundles of crumbling $20 bills from DB Cooper's ransom money were unearthed by a small boy on a sandbar in the Columbia River in 1980. (Supplied: FBI)The documents, at times heavily redacted, outline leads and suspects pursued by the FBI over the years.At one point, a man in a wheelchair became their key suspect, only to be ruled out. It is believed that the hijacker in this case has full use of all of his extremities and witnesses did not tell of any physical disability, the agent wrote. A man confined to a wheel chair [sic] did not hijack the plane in this case. Other men investigated included former pilots and members of multiple different skydiving clubs who bore a resemblance to Cooper.Men who did not resemble the artist’s sketch but who had mentioned different ways to hijack an airplane or suggested the way to hijack [and] escape would be … using a parachute were also reported to police.Several documents include long and redacted lists of suspects whose photographs were shown to witnesses without success.A contributing editor for Newsweek magazine, Karl Fleming, told the FBI he had placed an ad in multiple newspapers asking DB Cooper to contact him.Heists that shocked the worldThe plane hijacking by DB Cooper is just one of a series of high-profile robberies which have hit the headlines around the world.The ad included his home phone number.He said he had been contacted and met multiple times with a man who identified himself as Cooper.At one point, he said he had been shown several $20 bills he said he was 98 per cent positive matched copies of the ransom money shown to him by an unknown source.He handed over $US30,000 ($45,810) for the exclusive interview, publishing a three-part series detailing Cooper’s side of the story.Two men were later convicted and sentenced to serve time in federal prison for impersonating Cooper and pocketing the money.The rest of the files do not draw any definitive conclusion.'DB Cooper, Where Are You?' In the years since the hijacking, the story has become part of American pop culture history.By 1972, T-shirts bearing the phrase DB Cooper, Where Are You? were already appearing in novelty shops across the west coast.A magazine cover featuring DB Cooper published in 1976, included in National Archives files. (National Archives)There have been dozens of fiction and non-fiction books about the case, as well as references in film and television.In David Lynch’s 1990 TV series Twin Peaks, the main character is named Dale Bartholomew Cooper — a nod to the now infamous hijacker.More recently, DB Cooper was revealed to be Loki in the Disney+ series Loki, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.An annual CooperCon convention is held in Seattle, letting Cooper enthusiasts and researchers swap theories.None of it has led to any answers.Max Shaffer, then chief of security for the Seattle region of the Federal Aviation Administration, told the New York Times in 1972 he believed Cooper was dead. I feel that one of these days some hunter in Oregon or Washington is going to find the skeleton of this man, he said.As of July 12, 2016, the FBI had officially ended their investigation, leaving it as one of the longest cold cases in the agency’s history. The mystery surrounding the hijacking of a Northwest Orient Airlines flight in 1971 by a still-unknown individual resulted in significant international attention and a decades-long manhunt, they said in a statement. Evidence obtained during the course of the investigation will now be preserved for historical purposes at FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC.

(Supplied)In short:Former Sydney bikie Hakan Ayik's alleged role in the biggest police sting in history can finally be revealed after the release of US court documents.Mr Ayik is facing 262 years in jail in Türkiye for a raft of alleged drug crimes and money laundering offences.Though he may never face justice in Australia due to Turkish extradition laws.abc.net.au/news/nsw-most-wanted-man-former-sydney-bikie-hakan-ayik/105518070Link copiedShareShare articleAfter 18 months of silence from authorities, fresh details of just how one of Australia's most wanted men allegedly duped his criminal associates into a police trap can be revealed.Hakan Ayik has been sitting in a Turkish prison awaiting trial since 2023 with no word on his role in what the Australian Federal Police (AFP) described as the country's biggest organised crime sting.Sydney-born Mr Ayik had led Australian law enforcement on a decade-long manhunt, avoiding capture for a series of alleged drug crimes, before his dramatic arrest in Istanbul.In the time since he fled to Türkiye over a decade ago, police had alleged Mr Ayik helped form the Aussie cartel , a group of overseas-based Australian drug importers.It earned him a spot on NSW Police's most wanted list, where he remains to this day.A mugshot of Hakan Ayik, taken when he was wanted by the NSW Police more than 10 years ago. (Facebook)Their intelligence on Mr Ayik came after he was unwittingly recruited into spreading a police-bugged app, called AN0M, into the underworld by the AFP.The joint AFP and FBI operation involved planting the devices into the hands of criminals and watching on as they used it to organise murders, drug shipments and beatings in Australia and abroad.No AN0M cases against anyone charged in Australia have ever revealed what, if any, link they had to Mr Ayik, deepening the mystery of who one senior law enforcement source described as a Mr Big of the underworld .But a trove of court documents from the United States, released in recent months, reveal his alleged role in luring his mates into the police trap.The man behind the 'Oscar' monikerAs part of their investigation the AFP revealed how rival bikies and crime families would work together using AN0M to supply drugs all over Australia.In court documents from related AN0M cases in the United States, prosecutors described Mr Ayik as an influencer — a role that proved a profitable side hustle.In one filing referring to Mr Ayik under his AN0M username Oscar , one of his associates described how all the profits from the sale of 100 devices would go straight to him.Alleged Australian drug lord Hakan Ayik poses in a Facebook profile photo. (Facebook)That transaction would earn him $75,000 in Bitcoin, according to court documents.The same underling, the documents said, would go on to discuss in messages on the device how Mr Ayik and the crew could start a VIP service for certain AN0M customers.Others paint the picture of Mr Ayik as being the go-to person for AN0M, who would go on to sell more than 12,000 devices as well as allegedly leading the Comanchero from overseas.The Comanchero are one of the most powerful bikie gangs in Australia, who suffered a power struggle during Sydney's recent gangland war.What the AN0M device looked like, before it was revealed to be a police Trojan horse app. (Supplied: AFP)In another court document from the United States, an underling asks Mr Ayik: Touching base with you in relation to AN0M device we prepared for client Tiger? Another describes how Mr Ayik is alleged to have sent clients to those under him and how those clients paid cash through a family member of Mr Ayik.When news of the AN0M operation first broke, rumours from underworld and police sources purported Mr Ayik had fled for his safety to either Syria or Iraq.Two years later in 2023, 46-year-old Mr Ayik would be apprehended shirtless by Turkish police in a posh apartment belonging to him in the heart of Istanbul.Hakan Ayik, during his now infamous capture in Istanbul in 2023. (Reuters: Turkish Interior Ministry/Handout )Charges with a 262-year jail termMr Ayik lived a life of luxury while on the run in Türkiye, though the alleged drug kingpin will likely never face justice down under.Among the lavish hotels, cars and businesses in Istanbul, Mr Ayik was far from going to ground while wanted for a raft of serious drug offences across the globe.Vast swathes of his wealth have now been seized by Turkish authorities who are prosecuting him for a series of alleged drug crimes and money laundering offences.If convicted he faces 262 years in prison.Mr Ayik was rumoured to be a billion-dollar bikie while posting flashy social media snaps on the run and estimates of his wealth ranged from $250 million to as high as $1 billion.The former Sydney bikie is also wanted on a racketeering indictment in the US and appears on watch lists for police authorities from Europe to Australia.Hotels fit for a kingThe Kings Cross Hotel in Istanbul, owned by alleged Sydney crime boss Hakan Ayik.

(Supplied: Supreme Court of Western Australia)Instead, the pellets hit and killed Ralph Matthews Cox, who did not know Nguyen-Ha and had no involvement in the drug world.The jury deliberated for two days before finding Nguyen-Ha guilty of one charge of murder, as well as five counts of doing an act likely to endanger life.Final act in series of shootingsDuring his trial, Nguyen-Ha admitted firing the gun twice but claimed he replaced the shotgun shells with pellets filled with rock salt.He told the court it was his alleged accomplice, Matthew Gempton, who fired a third, fatal shot with a different gun.Gempton, a self-described debt collector, already received a reduced sentence for manslaughter over his role in the shooting after agreeing to be a key witness in Nguyen-Ha's trial.He admitted being Nguyen-Ha's driver in the shooting but said it was his accomplice who fired the gun.Police found Ralph Matthews Cox critically injured at a house in Landsdale in January 2022. (ABC News)The intended target of the shooting, Anthony Prior, admitted in court he had bashed Nguyen-Ha and stolen tens of thousands of dollars from him in late 2021, in a set-up which involved fake drugs.That triggered two earlier shootings at homes in Perth's northern suburbs in which Nguyen-Ha, along with Gempton, were targeting Prior.The prosecution maintained that in those shootings Nguyen-Ha was not a mere bystander but was a planner, and that he was indeed the lone gunman in the final Landsdale shooting.On that night, Mr Cox and his partner were asleep in their front bedroom and stirred when they heard someone outside.He said I've been hit , when he was shot, the court heard.Nguyen-Ha will face a sentencing hearing on August 22.

You agreed to go with him without making any further inquiries as to what was planned or what was happening … you clearly knew that a confrontation was likely to occur. 'Humiliating and degrading' act filmedDuring the confrontation, which involved a group of youths, the man was threatened with a machete and blocked from leaving.Ms Micallef said the man was forced to transfer money to one of the other youths' accounts, and told to remove his shirt and kiss the shoes of the group or he would be assaulted.The man initially refused and was punched. As he was in fear, he did what was asked of him and it was filmed — that is the humiliating and degrading act, Ms Micallef said.She said the victim fled and later tried to have the money returned via his bank but stopped the investigation when he received threats that the footage and embarrassing messages would be released to his family and workplace.Ms Micallef said the victim would always have a concern that the video footage of him is still out there in the cloud somewhere .She said the teen had agreed he was equally responsible for the offending despite not being the instigator or the planner .The teenager had pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated robbery, blackmail and engaging in humiliating or degrading filming in relation to that incident, along with aggravated robbery and attempted aggravated robbery in relation to a second incident in April this year.The men were lured to meet with the youths via social media. (AP: Jenny Kane)Ms Micallef said the second incident involved ambushing two men who were lured to a public area, for what they thought would be a sexual experiment, or interaction, with a third male .She said the two men saw someone in the dark , and were asked, but refused, to go back to their house or a school before they were threatened with a machete.A group of youths, including the now-18-year-old, assaulted the men — one of whom was put in a headlock — and tried to take their keys and wallets, but the men escaped and alerted the police.Ms Micallef said the teen was again not involved in the set-up, nor wielding the machete or making threats but was willingly present.She said the teen — who had spent about two weeks in youth detention after his arrest — had a stable home life, was well-behaved at school and had provided multiple glowing character references to the court.The magistrate said the teen had recognised that despite being long-time friends, the youth who organised the meetings was now a negative influence on your behaviour .'Vigilante behaviour is not acceptable'She said the court had been told that aside from his close friend, he did not know the other youths involved and had been dragged into the offending. Whilst I can accept that the first time you joined your childhood friend you may have not been aware of the planned robbery or humiliation or blackmail … but you did participate in it, she said. You did not leave, nor did you try to stop it. Even if you did nothing but stand there, by your presence you made it frightening for the victim and supported the others in that action. I can also accept that to some extent you may have thought that you were dealing with, or somehow punishing someone who was behaving inappropriately, or about to. However, this behaviour cannot be condoned in any way … this type of vigilante behaviour is not acceptable. Ms Micallef diverted the youth to family conferencing for the offences against the first victim and imposed a six-month good behaviour bond for the second incident. She did not impose any convictions.Posted Thu 10 Jul 2025 at 8:05pmThursday 10 Jul 2025 at 8:05pmThu 10 Jul 2025 at 8:05pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top Stories'Raise taxes to fix budget': Treasury advises Labor in accidentally published adviceTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows Jim Chalmers reads the budget book in his office.The PDF stuff-up that tells us the Treasury isn't afraid to tell the boss the uncomfortable truthAnalysis by Daniel ZifferPhoto shows The front exterior of the Treasury building in Canberra.PM to meet business leaders in Shanghai for green steel roundtableTopic:Foreign AffairsPhoto shows Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wears yellow tie and navy jacket, blue steel behind himSinner creates tennis history after outclassing Alcaraz in Wimbledon finalTopic:TennisPhoto shows Jannik Sinner poses with the Wimbledon trophyChina love-bombs Australia while US demands to know what we'd do in event of warPAnalysis by Patricia KarvelasPhoto shows Albanese looks serious, behind him is a dark backgroundPopular nowCouncil issues building orders to shocked tiny home residentsTopic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Evrim Sen inside her tiny house.Court agrees to hear pensioner's $379m claim against NAB over $1300 debit card scamTopic:BankingPhoto shows Ian wears a black coat and red scarf with hands in his pockets looking into the camera outside the a stone courthouseChina love-bombs Australia while US demands to know what we'd do in event of warPAnalysis by Patricia KarvelasPhoto shows Albanese looks serious, behind him is a dark backgroundRelated topicsAdelaideCourtsCrimeLaw, Crime and JusticeSASentencingTop Stories'Raise taxes to fix budget': Treasury advises Labor in accidentally published adviceTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows Jim Chalmers reads the budget book in his office.The PDF stuff-up that tells us the Treasury isn't afraid to tell the boss the uncomfortable truthAnalysis by Daniel ZifferPM to meet business leaders in Shanghai for green steel roundtableTopic:Foreign AffairsSinner creates tennis history after outclassing Alcaraz in Wimbledon finalTopic:TennisChina love-bombs Australia while US demands to know what we'd do in event of warPAnalysis by Patricia KarvelasJust InDriver critical after being found with gunshot wound in car wreckTopic:Shootings12m ago12 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 8:22pmPM to meet business leaders in Shanghai for green steel roundtableTopic:Foreign Affairs20m ago20 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 8:14pmResearchers hope new injection will one day be a 'game-changer' for people living with Parkinson'sTopic:Medical Research24m ago24 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 8:10pmCold, frosty mornings but sunny days for return to schoolTopic:Weather35m ago35 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 7:59pmMore Just InBack to top 'Raise taxes to fix budget': Treasury advises Labor in accidentally published adviceTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows Jim Chalmers reads the budget book in his office.

(Supplied: Gander family)In short: A jury has begun deliberating in the trial of three people accused of kidnapping, murdering and burning the body of 19-year-old Charlie Gander in northern Victoria in December 2022. The prosecutor alleges the three acted in agreement, motivated by revenge against the teenager.What's next? The judge has told the jury they must reach a unanimous verdict for each accused who faces three charges. abc.net.au/news/charlie-gander-supreme-court-murder-trial-jury-deliberates/105517906Link copiedShareShare articleA jury has begun deliberating in the trial of three people accused of kidnapping, murdering and burning the body of a 19-year-old in northern Victoria in December 2022. The remains of Charlie Gander's body were found in a burnt-out car at Bunbartha on Christmas Eve, 2022.Kylie Stott, Dimitri D'Elio and Danny Clarke have pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, murder and arson in a trial painted by the prosecution as a desire for revenge against Charlie for ratting out their associate to the police.The jury was shown photos taken by Victoria Police of the burnt car, which contained the remains of Charlie Gander's body. (Supplied: Supreme Court of Victoria)At the time of the alleged offending, Ms Stott was aged 37, Mr D'Elio 24 and Mr Clarke 38.All three have pleaded not guilty.The 12 jurors have begun deliberating after 30 days of hearings, including about 41 witnesses made up of pathologists, DNA experts, emergency services and police officers. The jury also heard statements read out by the prosecutor from Mr Gander's girlfriend and his father Richard Gander, including final texts between the pair. Police evidence cost teenager 'dearly', says CrownIn his final address, Mr Gibson argued that each of the accused was guilty of the three charges because each of them was part of an agreement, arrangement or understanding with the others to kidnap Charlie Gander, to murder Charlie Gander and to burn the Ford Territory with Charlie Gander's body in it .Mr Gibson told the jury the alleged motive was Mr Gander's cooperation with police investigating a firearms breach by Tyson May, who was a good friend of Ms Stott. Mr Gander was also friends with Mr May and would hang out with him, the court heard.Following a police raid in Shepparton in November 2022, Mr Gander gave a police interview and made a witness statement about Mr May possessing a firearm. The court heard Gander's body contained high levels of ice, which could not be ruled out as a cause of death. (Supplied: Gander family)Mr May was under a firearms prohibition order, Mr Gibson said. A disc with the record of Mr Gander's police interview found its way into the hands of others , Mr Gibson said. It cost him dearly, he said.The court heard a kitchen knife wrapped in a bloodstained tea towel from under a car seat had a mixed DNA profile of four people, including Mr Gander. Forensic pathologist Paul Bedford, who conducted Mr Gander's autopsy, previously told the court extensive fire damage to the body meant the cause of death could not be ascertained.He also told the court toxicology reports had found very high levels of the drug methylamphetamine, commonly known as ice, which may have contributed to Mr Gander's death.Defence arguments Justice Michael Croucher presented a summary of the defence counsel's arguments to the court before the jury began deliberating.Daniel Sala, acting for Ms Stott, has rejected the prosecution's arguments that she was key in orchestrating the acts against Mr Gander and urged the jury to find her not guilty of murder or arson. Paul Kounnas, acting on behalf of Mr D'Elio, has argued Ms Stott and Mr Clarke were the prime movers in the alleged crimes and that Mr D'Elio was dragged along and used as a patsy . Emergency services found the car on fire on a dirt road in Bunbartha in Victoria's north. (Supplied: Supreme Court of Victoria)The court heard Mr D'Elio, who was in a relationship with Ms Stott, did not know Mr Gander or Mr Clarke and had no skin in the game .Christopher Terry, acting on behalf of Mr Clarke, has argued his client did not intend to kill Mr Gander or enter into any agreement to do so. He said there was no evidence of Mr Clarke's hatred towards Mr Gander or proof of an agreement, and that his client had been dragged into a terrible crime .Charges heard togetherJustice Croucher instructed the jury that they must reach a unanimous verdict for each of the accused, who each face three charges. The jury heard they may find the accused guilty of manslaughter as an alternative if they are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the higher charge of murder. Justice Croucher told the jury manslaughter did not require an intent to kill, but there must be an intentional assault that was dangerous and posed serious injury. He also told the jury their task did not include making moral judgements.He noted jurors had been tasked with not one trial but 12 separate decisions, with the three accused facing three charges and the potential for manslaughter. The 12 charges are being heard together for convenience, and the jury must not allow this fact to usurp justice and must consider each charge separately, Justice Croucher said.Posted Thu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:39amThursday 10 Jul 2025 at 9:39amThu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:39am, updated Thu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:41amThursday 10 Jul 2025 at 9:41amThu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:41amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top Stories'Raise taxes to fix budget': Treasury advises Labor in accidentally published adviceTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows Jim Chalmers reads the budget book in his office.The PDF stuff-up that tells us the Treasury isn't afraid to tell the boss the uncomfortable truthAnalysis by Daniel ZifferPhoto shows The front exterior of the Treasury building in Canberra.PM to meet business leaders in Shanghai for green steel roundtableTopic:Foreign AffairsPhoto shows Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wears yellow tie and navy jacket, blue steel behind himSinner creates tennis history after outclassing Alcaraz in Wimbledon finalTopic:TennisPhoto shows Jannik Sinner poses with the Wimbledon trophyChina love-bombs Australia while US demands to know what we'd do in event of warPAnalysis by Patricia KarvelasPhoto shows Albanese looks serious, behind him is a dark backgroundPopular nowCouncil issues building orders to shocked tiny home residentsTopic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Evrim Sen inside her tiny house.Court agrees to hear pensioner's $379m claim against NAB over $1300 debit card scamTopic:BankingPhoto shows Ian wears a black coat and red scarf with hands in his pockets looking into the camera outside the a stone courthouseChina love-bombs Australia while US demands to know what we'd do in event of warPAnalysis by Patricia KarvelasPhoto shows Albanese looks serious, behind him is a dark backgroundRelated topicsBunbarthaCourtsCrimeMelbourneSheppartonTop Stories'Raise taxes to fix budget': Treasury advises Labor in accidentally published adviceTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows Jim Chalmers reads the budget book in his office.The PDF stuff-up that tells us the Treasury isn't afraid to tell the boss the uncomfortable truthAnalysis by Daniel ZifferPM to meet business leaders in Shanghai for green steel roundtableTopic:Foreign AffairsSinner creates tennis history after outclassing Alcaraz in Wimbledon finalTopic:TennisChina love-bombs Australia while US demands to know what we'd do in event of warPAnalysis by Patricia KarvelasJust InDriver critical after being found with gunshot wound in car wreckTopic:Shootings12m ago12 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 8:22pmPM to meet business leaders in Shanghai for green steel roundtableTopic:Foreign Affairs20m ago20 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 8:14pmResearchers hope new injection will one day be a 'game-changer' for people living with Parkinson'sTopic:Medical Research24m ago24 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 8:10pmCold, frosty mornings but sunny days for return to schoolTopic:Weather35m ago35 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 7:59pmMore Just InBack to top 'Raise taxes to fix budget': Treasury advises Labor in accidentally published adviceTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows Jim Chalmers reads the budget book in his office.

Ms McGuire was reported missing by her family in April last year, and her body was later found in a burnt-out vehicle south-west of Ballarat. Hannah McGuire, 23, was found dead inside a burnt-out vehicle in April last year. (Supplied: GoFundMe)In opening remarks, chief prosecutor Kristie Churchill told the court Ms McGuire's three-year relationship with Mr Young was controlling and turbulent , and included a series of intervention orders.In one instance, Ms Churchill said Mr Young called Ms McGuire 129 times in a single day.The prosecution will argue that Mr Young murdered Ms McGuire at the Sebastopol home they once shared, before putting her body in the footwell of a car, driving her out to a remote location, and setting both on fire. Ms Churchill told the court that autopsy reports concluded Ms McGuire was dead before the fire started. The prosecution said it would argue Mr Young staged Ms McGuire's death to look like a suicide and systematically deleted evidence.The prosecution rejected Lachlan Young's guilty plea to manslaughter. (Instagram)It is alleged Mr Young seized Ms McGuire's phone post murder and sent text messages as Ms McGuire to her mother and himself. I'm sorry mum, I thought this was the right decision. I tried to heal and cope with it all but I'm not ok, read the beginning of one text Mr Young sent from Ms McGuire's phone to her mother.The prosecution will also argue Mr Young transferred thousands of dollars to Ms McGuire's mother and himself and continued to spread a bunch of lies to friends, family, and police in the days after her murder.Floral tributes were left for Hannah McGuire at the site where her remains were found. (AAP: Con Chronis )Charge of murderMr Young's defence, led by Glenn Casement, told the court the 22-year old man made a very serious admission pleading guilty to manslaughter.Mr Casement said although Mr Young made a series of appalling, bad choices in an attempt to obscure what he did, he did not kill Ms McGuire with murderous intent .The Supreme Court will sit in Ballarat for the next five weeks. (ABC News: Julia Bergin)The defence will argue Mr Young's actions were foolish and shameful , but Ms McGuire's death was an unplanned and spontaneous event .Throughout the next five weeks, the court will hear from a number of witnesses, including friends, family, medical experts, and the man who assisted Mr Young to dispose of the car containing Ms McGuire's body. What's next?A jury of 14 was empanelled on Wednesday morning and will be required to make a unanimous decision, beyond reasonable doubt, on whether Mr Young murdered Ms McGuire.There are four key elements they need to satisfy: that Mr Young caused the death of Ms McGuire, that he did so consciously, voluntarily and deliberately, that he intended to kill or cause serious injury, and that there was no lawful justification or excuse for his actions.

They have been compromised by people of their own nationality, Assistant Commissioner Wood said. The evidence will be alleged that they have come from China into Australia to commit these crimes and then return. Assistant Commissioner Wood said those targeted were some of the most vulnerable in the community, who allegedly lost $3 million. They, I would describe, are very, very vulnerable people, he said. The majority are female and elderly. They underpin the word vulnerability. And that's what makes this scam, this crime, let's not call it a scam, this crime, so serious. They are like piranhas; they are circling around vulnerable people and they are robbing them, at times, of huge amounts of money.

There's no rules with these people; they're predators. When they see an opportunity, when they need to work as a group they will work as a group, he said. It is extremely sad to see how they act, targeting individuals who are vulnerable, who are elderly. They have no chance. Police released photos of those accused of being involved in the operation in the hope people with information on their whereabouts and alleged involvement in the group will come forward.Posted Wed 9 Jul 2025 at 4:31amWednesday 9 Jul 2025 at 4:31amWed 9 Jul 2025 at 4:31am, updated Wed 9 Jul 2025 at 5:58amWednesday 9 Jul 2025 at 5:58amWed 9 Jul 2025 at 5:58amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top Stories'Raise taxes to fix budget': Treasury advises Labor in accidentally published adviceTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows Jim Chalmers reads the budget book in his office.The PDF stuff-up that tells us the Treasury isn't afraid to tell the boss the uncomfortable truthAnalysis by Daniel ZifferPhoto shows The front exterior of the Treasury building in Canberra.PM to meet business leaders in Shanghai for green steel roundtableTopic:Foreign AffairsPhoto shows Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wears yellow tie and navy jacket, blue steel behind himSinner creates tennis history after outclassing Alcaraz in Wimbledon finalTopic:TennisPhoto shows Jannik Sinner poses with the Wimbledon trophyChina love-bombs Australia while US demands to know what we'd do in event of warPAnalysis by Patricia KarvelasPhoto shows Albanese looks serious, behind him is a dark backgroundPopular nowCouncil issues building orders to shocked tiny home residentsTopic:Housing PolicyPhoto shows Evrim Sen inside her tiny house.Court agrees to hear pensioner's $379m claim against NAB over $1300 debit card scamTopic:BankingPhoto shows Ian wears a black coat and red scarf with hands in his pockets looking into the camera outside the a stone courthouseChina love-bombs Australia while US demands to know what we'd do in event of warPAnalysis by Patricia KarvelasPhoto shows Albanese looks serious, behind him is a dark backgroundRelated topicsCrimeHornsbyParramattaPoliceSydneyTop Stories'Raise taxes to fix budget': Treasury advises Labor in accidentally published adviceTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows Jim Chalmers reads the budget book in his office.The PDF stuff-up that tells us the Treasury isn't afraid to tell the boss the uncomfortable truthAnalysis by Daniel ZifferPM to meet business leaders in Shanghai for green steel roundtableTopic:Foreign AffairsSinner creates tennis history after outclassing Alcaraz in Wimbledon finalTopic:TennisChina love-bombs Australia while US demands to know what we'd do in event of warPAnalysis by Patricia KarvelasJust InDriver critical after being found with gunshot wound in car wreckTopic:Shootings12m ago12 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 8:22pmPM to meet business leaders in Shanghai for green steel roundtableTopic:Foreign Affairs21m ago21 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 8:14pmResearchers hope new injection will one day be a 'game-changer' for people living with Parkinson'sTopic:Medical Research24m ago24 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 8:10pmCold, frosty mornings but sunny days for return to schoolTopic:Weather35m ago35 minutes agoSun 13 Jul 2025 at 7:59pmMore Just InBack to top 'Raise taxes to fix budget': Treasury advises Labor in accidentally published adviceTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows Jim Chalmers reads the budget book in his office.

Suarez pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit bank and mail fraud, along with aggravated identity theft. He faces several years in prison, including mandatory-minimum punishment of two years for the ID theft conviction, at his sentencing hearing in September before U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams.Suarez was indicted in 2023 but was living in Panama City, Panama, at the time. In early 2025, he was arrested in Panama and brought to South Florida to face the charges. According to a factual statement filed with his plea agreement, here’s how Suarez carried out the scam during an FBI-led undercover operation:More than 80 fraudulent checksIn March 2022, Suarez told a confidential informant that he had access to the bank account of an elderly person, who was 82 years old at the time. Suarez created and mailed dozens of falsified checks from Panama to South Florida to the victim’s bank with directions to cash them and return half of the money to his account at Bank of America. The ill-gotten proceeds were wired to his Miami-based company, Online Electronics.To carry out the scheme, Suarez’s fraudulent checks contained forged signatures designed to resemble that of the victim’s on a signature card at Truist Bank.“In total, Suarez and his co-conspirators stole $803,146 from [the victim’s] bank account at Truist through the issuance of more than 80 fraudulent checks to numerous different payees, including at least five individuals and various companies,” according to the factual statement signed by the defendant, his lawyer and a prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami.The statement also said the elderly person reviewed the names of the individuals and companies involved in the fraudulent check transactions. The person did not authorize any of them.The case, investigated by the FBI, Secret Service and FDIC’s Office of Inspector General, was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Thor Pogozelski.This story was originally published July 10, 2025 at 11:32 AM.

Police won’t talk Crime A month after Miami arrest warrant, Antonio Brown is still in Dubai. Police won’t talk By Grethel Aguila and Charles Rabin July 10, 2025 5:40 PM More than a month after a Miami-Dade judge signed an arrest warrant for former NFL star Antonio Brown, saying he tried to shoot someone outside a celebrity boxing event in Little Haiti, the former all pro has not been taken into custody. Miami Police are not saying what they’re doing to bring him back. Jason Getz Jason Getz-USA TODAY Sports A month after being charged with attempted murder, former NFL star Antonio Brown has posted videos on social media flaunting his lavish lifestyle abroad — riding around in expensive cars and sauntering on a yacht overlooking Dubai’s skyscrapers.It’s almost as if Brown, 37, were taunting police. But Miami Police will not say whether they consider Brown on the run — or if they’re working to bring him back to the U.S. to face trial.A Miami-Dade judge signed off on Brown’s arrest warrant a month ago. But police don’t appear to be looking for him and refuse to discuss the case. There’s also no record or court date for Brown in the database of Miami-Dade circuit court records.READ MORE: Antonio Brown charged with attempted murder after shooting at Miami boxing eventIn a video uploaded to X on Thursday, Brown is seen celebrating his birthday in a red Ferrari 812 GTS and hanging out with his young sons on the water. In another, he is smiling at the camera as he films the sun setting on the Dubai skyline.Meanwhile, Miami Police remain tight-lipped about its efforts — and deadlines — to get Brown to return. Yacht day https://t.co/Xgp6fO6cem— AB (@AB84) July 10, 2025 “The process of determining fugitive status and initiating retrieval efforts depends on various factors, including the nature of the charges, jurisdictional protocols, and international cooperation,” police told the Herald. “We cannot provide timelines as every case differs.”READ MORE: Ex-NFL star Antonio Brown is no stranger to police, discipline in his careerAttorney Mauricio Padilla, who practices criminal law in South Florida and Puerto Rico, said it’s unusual for someone with such a serious charge to remain abroad a month after a judge signed an arrest warrant.“They have given him a lot of leeway,” Padilla said. “Usually, celebrity or not, they want you here.”Brown is accused of shooting at Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu, a 41-year-old man who designs and sells jewelry, after a dispute escalated on May 16 outside a Miami boxing event hosted by social media influencer Adin Ross. After the shooting, Brown said on social media that he was attacked by people trying to steal his jewelry. Breaking: Antonio Brown is going to break the internet@AB84 #CTEPN #SteelerLegend pic.twitter.com/ABKGGw507Y— Say Less (@SayLessHQ) May 17, 2025 Brown, who grew up in South Florida, falsely accused Nantambu of stealing $3 million in jewelry from him, according to a lawsuit filed by Nantambu. The jewelry designer spent a month in jail in the United Arab Emirates, documents show, before proving that Brown lied.READ MORE: Antonio Brown’s false accusations put Miami jeweler in Dubai jail for month: lawsuitPeople accused of crimes usually negotiate with authorities to surrender upon their return. Brown had an attorney early on who secured him a $10,000 bond, including house arrest. As of Thursday, it’s unclear if Brown was being represented by an attorney. Another unknown: whether prosecutors will continue to honor the bond agreement in place. Brown could be detained by the FBI or U.S. Marshals if Miami Police or the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office request that the federal agencies issue a warrant for Brown’s return, said Jeffrey Sloman, a Miami criminal defense attorney who served briefly as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. This is usually accomplished through a federal charge brought forward if a person is avoiding prosecution. If a person remains a fugitive, they may not be granted bond to get out of jail, or a judge could be more harsh in their confinement, Sloman said. The attorney said to look no further than his client Ohad Fisherman, who was on his honeymoon in Japan but returned quickly to address the criminal charge against him. Fisherman — who was entangled in one of the cases brought by the state against the Alexander brothers — had a sex crime charge against him dropped on Monday by state prosecutors.READ MORE: Alexander brothers’ friend cleared in sex case — tearful, angry at state prosecutors“It’s in [Brown’s] best interest to come back immediately, so hopefully the judge would give him a reasonable bond so he can fight the charges out of jail,” Sloman said. “It’s very difficult to fight a case in jail. If Mr. Brown continues to avoid prosecution, eventually he will travel somewhere or to some place and he will be arrested.”Padilla told the Herald police likely believe that Brown will return to South Florida because he has property and children in the area. Formally extraditing Brown, he said, would be costly.

Daniel A. Varela dvarela@miamiherald.com “It’s not easy for the FBI to be dragging people from the Middle East,” Padilla said. “There’ll be a point that if this continues, it could manifest into something larger.”Brown should contact an attorney to turn himself in, Padilla said, because a judge could factor in the amount of time he was abroad after the warrant was signed when deciding his bond. “This is a serious crime. This isn’t going to go away,” Padilla said. “...He’s going to have to face these charges.” Grethel Aguila Miami Herald Go to X Email this person Grethel covers courts and the criminal justice system for the Miami Herald.

He was the father of two children. The driver was arrested Tuesday, July 8, 2025. GoFundMe Andres Roberto Fiallos Estupiñan, accused of running down and killing a father who was jogging in his Shenandoah neighborhood, was booked into jail Tuesday after he was released from Jackson Memorial Hospital, where police had to Taser him to subdue him, his attorney said.Fiallos Estupiñan had been hospitalized since June 10 after suffering a broken ankle while fleeing the scene of the fatal hit-and-run at Southwest 21st Avenue and 18th Street. Residents tackled him near Shenandoah Park after they say he struck 50-year-old jogger Andrew Loretta with a Volkswagen Jetta, then careened into an ice cream truck and several other vehicles before attempting to run away.Jail records show that Fiallos Estupiñan, 36, was hit with multiple charges, including leaving the scene of the crash involving death, leaving the scene of a crash with serious bodily injury, reckless driving and vehicular homicide. READ MORE: Suspect in Miami hit-and-run unconscious for weeks after hospital clash with copsPsychotic episode caused the tragedy, attorney saysFiallos Estupiñan was hospitalized for weeks and listed in critical condition, leaving his family and attorney reeling with questions on how his condition deteriorated when he went in for a broken ankle. His attorney, Bradley Horenstein, said Fiallos Estupiñan — who has a history of mental health issues — had a psychotic episode that started before the crash.“This unimaginably tragic case is the result of Mr. Fiallos Estupiñan having suffered a psychotic break, which the hospital spent weeks successfully treating with medication,” Horenstein told the Miami Herald Wednesday.According to Horenstein, Fiallos Estupiñan became agitated while handcuffed to a hospital bed and attempted to get up and leave. A Miami police officer stationed at his bedside Tasered Fiallos Estupiñan multiple times to subdue him. When that had little effect, hospital staff gave him ketamine, an anesthetic used for surgery, and Estupinan was intubated for his safety. A psychiatric evaluation conducted at the hospital provided further detail on the severity of Fiallos Estupiñan’s condition. According to the five-page report, he ripped out his IV line, jumped out of bed naked while handcuffed and set off a hospital alarm after throwing himself against a wall vent.Horenstein said doctors continued to sedate him as he was not responding to medications for the psychosis. Further, Fiallos Estupiñan developed pneumonia and a bacterial infection in his lungs, which landed him in critical condition and the Intensive Care Unit. Andres Roberto Fiallo Estupinan, accused of the hit-and-run death of a Shenandoah father out for a jog on June 10, was jailed Tuesday, July 8, 2025. He’s facing a slew of charges. Estupinan family photo For three weeks, Horenstein was unable to speak to his client due to the heavy sedation.At one point, doctors performed a tracheotomy to avoid long-term damage to his vocal cords from prolonged intubation. Horenstein noted the situation was so dire that his client’s mother was granted a humanitarian visa to fly to the U.S. and sit by his bedside.“The hospital and the City of Miami Police Department were very accommodating,” Horenstein said.Fiallos Estupiñan was slowly weaned off the sedatives as the anti-psychotic medication began to take effect; he is now lucid and calm, Horenstein said.Set to be released on conditionsFiallos Estupiñan appeared in Miami-Dade Bond Court on Wednesday before Judge Gisela Cardonne Ely in an orange jumpsuit with a visible cast on his leg. At the hearing, prosecutors said Fiallos Estupiñan was driving 75 miles per hour in a 25-mph residential zone at the time of the crash. They argued he is both a danger to the community and a flight risk.Prosecutors requested Fiallos Estupiñan’s total bond be set at no less than $100,000 and that if released, he be placed on house arrest, be barred from driving and have his passport confiscated.Horenstein pushed back, telling the judge his client is not a danger to himself or others, but made no arguments on the $100,000 bond. He noted that Fiallos Estupiñan had been hospitalized for nearly a month after the crash and is a commercial engineer by profession. His mother and sister were present in the courtroom.The judge set bond at $25,000 for each charge, for a total of $100,000. She also ordered Fiallos Estupiñan to be placed on Level 2 house arrest, meaning he can only leave home for work, church or meetings with his lawyer.Fiallos Estupiñan, who was born in Ecuador and lived in Chile, was also ordered to surrender his passport before being released from jail. Horenstein said the passport was believed to be inside Estupinan’s car, which has been impounded as evidence by the Miami Police Department.Despite that, Judge Cardonne Ely said the passport must be turned over before Estupinan could walk out of jail. Prosecutors asked Horenstein to provide proof the passport was not in his client’s possession. The judge removed the passport confiscation condition after Horenstein said he confirmed with the Miami Police sergeant supervising the case that the passport was in their possession.Witnesses held him downAccording to his arrest affidavit, Fiallos Estupiñan was driving a gray 2012 Volkswagen Passat on June 10 at a “high rate of speed” southbound on Southwest 21st Avenue near 17th Street just before 7 p.m. Police say he had an expired Florida driver’s license.At the same time, Andrew Loretta, 50, was jogging along the west side of 21st Avenue, heading toward 18th Street.Surveillance footage shows Fiallos Estupiñan striking the jogger from behind with such force that Loretta was thrown into the air and both of his legs were severed.After hitting Loretta, Fiallos Estupiñan crashed into a white 2013 Nissan ice cream van that was stopped at 21st Avenue and 18th Street, serving children at Shenandoah Park. Police say Estupinan made no “visible attempt to brake” before the impact.The Volkswagen then struck two more parked vehicles: a gray 2019 Toyota and a white 2023 Mercedes SUV, both on the west side of 21st Avenue near the park.Two witnesses told police that Fiallos Estupiñan immediately got out of the car and ran away without trying to help the injured jogger or calling 911. He ran into Shenandoah Park, where several bystanders stopped him and held him down until officers arrived.Loretta was pronounced dead at the scene. Estupinan had a broken ankle, while a passenger in one of the hit cars had a skull fracture.A beloved community memberIn Miami’s Shenandoah neighborhood, just off Coral Way, the sudden death of Loretta—a married telecommunications executive and father of two teenagers—has left his family heartbroken and the community in shock. Friends and relatives described him as an avid jogger and soccer enthusiast who moved to Miami from California in 2000. He was fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.A GoFundMe page to support Andrew’s family has raised over $193,000 with just over 900 donations.“I hope that justice is served. Not only for Andy, but for the family ... At the end of the day [Andres] has to deal with his own karma. I honestly feel a lot of compassion for him. It’s just a terrible situation,” John Loretta, Andrew’s cousin, who lives in Kendall, said.The Loretta family, including his wife and children, said in a statement through their attorney that they are grateful for the support they have received.“This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the Loretta family, and they remain deeply grateful for the outpouring of support from family, friends, and the community,” Raul Chacon, the family’s attorney, said in a statement to the Miami Herald. “At this point, they will have no further comment on the ongoing legal proceedings. Thank you for respecting their privacy and understanding their need to grieve in peace. “Miami Herald writer Isabel Rivera contributed to this report.This story was originally published July 9, 2025 at 4:17 PM.

Once limited to Southeast Asia, the criminal model is spreading — and uses AI.https://p.dw.com/p/4whWKOnline scam centers were initially concentrated in Cambodia, with additional trafficking hubs later uncovered in Laos and MyanmarImage: Kyodo News/IMAGOAdvertisementHuman trafficking-fueled scam centers have significantly expanded their operations worldwide, according to a crime trend update released on Monday by the international police agency Interpol. Hubs where trafficking victims are forced to take part in online fraud first emerged in a few Southeast Asian nations, but investigators are now also uncovering similar fraud centers in other regions. Where are scam centers spreading? According to the international police organization, victims now come from 66 countries across all continents, highlighting what Interpol describes as a global crisis involving hundreds of thousands of people. Scam centers are now increasingly found in other regions, including the Middle East, West Africa — fast emerging as a new regional hub — and Central America. Victims are often lured with fake job offers and then held captive in scam compounds. Many are blackmailed over alleged debts, beaten, sexually exploited, and in some cases tortured or raped. Inside these centers, they are forced to run online scams, mostly targeting people abroad to steal money.Freed captives describe scam operations in MyanmarTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video A 2024 Interpol-led operation exposed dozens of cases where victims were coerced into committing fraud, including a raid on an industrial-scale scam centre in the Philippines. That same year, police dismantled a centre in Namibia where 88 youths were forced to scam others. Emerging technologies are fuelling this trend further. The crime update notes a surge in the use of artificial intelligence, from generating fake job ads to creating deepfake profiles for sextortion and romance scams. Who are the victims? Interpol says the pool of those preyed upon has widened significantly. While early human trafficking victims were mainly Chinese-speaking and came from China, Malaysia, Thailand or Singapore, people are now being trafficked to such hubs from South America, East Africa and Western Europe. Tackling this rapidly globalizing threat requires a coordinated international response, said said Interpol's acting head of police services Cyril Gout. Who are the people traffickers? The report found that about 90% of human trafficking facilitators came from Asia, while 11% were from South America or Africa. About 80% of these facilitators were men, with 61% aged between 20 and 39. Online scam centers were initially concentrated in Cambodia, with additional trafficking hubs later uncovered in Laos and Myanmar. Today, similar operations have been identified in at least four more Asian countries, and evidence shows the model is spreading to other regions such as West Africa, where cyber-enabled financial crime is already common. In its findings, Interpol warned that the spread of such criminal networks needs urgent, coordinated action to disrupt trafficking routes and support victims. Interpol said that these criminal hubs are increasingly intertwined with other major transnational crimes, demanding a globally coordinated response. Trafficking routes used for scam centers are being exploited for smuggling drugs, firearms, and endangered wildlife like tigers and pangolins, Interpol said.

Here's how the death cap became the center of a chilling murder case. https://p.dw.com/p/4x8P8Even small amounts of death cap mushrooms are lethal if consumed.Image: Hans Reinhard/Okapia/picture-allianceAdvertisementA jury in Australia has found Erin Patterson guilty on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder. The murder weapon: Toxic mushrooms. Prosecutors argued Patterson intentionally served four of her family members with meal portions containing toxic death cap mushrooms in 2023. Patterson denied being guilty, originally telling police she had used store-bought mushrooms from a supermarket, then an Asian grocer in Melbourne. A search of such stores found no evidence that poisonous mushrooms had ever been sold. During the trial, Patterson said she may have foraged for the mushrooms but could not say for certain where she had obtained the death caps. Why are death cap mushrooms so deadly? Deadly by name and by nature, death cap mushrooms (Amanita phalloides) are full of a highly stable toxin called alpha-Amanitin. The toxin is so stable that it won't break down when exposed to heat in cooking. When a death cap is eaten, people don’t usually feel symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea until at least 6 hours later. During this time the alpha-Amanitin toxins are making their way through the bloodstream into organs of the body. The toxin primarily acts in the liver, where it causes cells in the liver to die. Alpha-Amanitin binds with RNA polymerase-II enzymes, preventing the cells from creating new proteins. Eventually, the liver starts to shut down. Death can occur within 24 hours. Careful identification required The Amanita genus of fungi is well-known for their toxic properties. This group include the fairytale toadstool commonly known as the fly agaric, death caps, and destroying angels . But some other Amanita mushrooms are edible. Most cases of death cap poisoning are often a case of misidentification — their classic white appearance and domed cap looks like many other types of fungi. Identification of mushrooms requires a knowledge of different parts of the anatomy: the cap or fruiting body, the gills or spores beneath the cap, and the stipe — or stalk. While death caps look like many other mushrooms, one defining characteristic is their bad smell. They don't store well at all, unless you dehydrate them. They quickly go very stinky and very nasty, Brett Summerell, a fungi expert and Chief Scientist at the Botanic Gardens of Sydney, Australia, told DW. Because of the risk of misidentification by amateurs, it's usually recommended that foragers go for edible species that cannot be mistaken. Of course, foraging under the supervision of a trained mycologist — a fungi scientist — is usually a safe option. The famous red and white toadstool is a member of the Amanita genus, and a cousin of other deadly mushroom species.Image: FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP No death caps in the supermarket The jury ultimately didn’t find Patterson’s defense — that she mixed up foraged mushrooms in the same container as store-bought ones — believable. The prosecution argued Patterson knowingly put the toxic mushrooms in the home-cooked lunch and disposed of evidence. Summerell said the likelihood that death caps could get into store-bought products is, to be honest, farcical. The reason? Death caps only grow next to oak and beech trees. Death caps, like many fungi, are mycorrhizal, meaning they have a symbiotic relationship with the tree species. Death caps obtain their nutrients from nearby tree roots and return nutrients to the nearby soil. But because they can only grow at the base of oak and beech trees, it means there's no chance of them sprouting in a commercial setting, where spores are cultivated in highly controlled conditions — and with no trees in sight. Australia could get rid of death caps Death caps aren’t native to Australia, and neither are the oak and beech trees that support them. The trees were first introduced into Australia from Europe in the 19th ecntury, and death caps in the 1960s. Summerell and other mycologists are now discussing the possibility of removing oak trees in some parts of Australia. We have argued that, in Sydney, if it's at all possible, we should start to think about removing oak trees from some of these suburbs just from the point of view of a public health risk, said Summerell. Removing introduced oaks could harbor positive benefits, both from a public health perspective by removing the risk of the top cause of mushroom poisoning, as well as providing more space for native Australian plant life.

But some criminologists doubt the figures.https://p.dw.com/p/4wuVjShoplifting is on the rise, say retailersImage: Carsten Milbret/imageBROKER/picture allianceAdvertisementGermany has never had more shoplifters than in 2024. An annual survey of 98 retailers estimates a 3% increase on the year before — amounting to some €4.95 billion ($5.84 billion) in losses. The latest study by Germany's Retail Institute (EHI) on inventory differences shows that the vast majority of those losses (€4.2 billion) was down to theft from customers, employees, or delivery workers, the EHI said, which would mean losses of some €570 million to the public purse through lost sales tax. The EHI also said that retailers had to resort to balancing out their losses and the costs of extra security by increasing prices. Study author Frank Horst calculated that some 1.5% of prices in stores could now be attributed to covering theft and security. Shoplifting techniques The EHI said there had also been a 5% increase in organized shoplifting, which accounted for a third of the total shoplifting losses. Horst said this could be individual thieves working their way through a shopping list, or else, the thefts could be carried out by coordinated groups. One of them drives a vehicle, one of them distracts the staff, or shields the one putting the goods away so they can't be seen, Horst told DW. Sometimes so-called depots are set up in the store, where all the goods are packed in a bag, and then someone else carries it out in a surreptitious moment. The survey does not include exact breakdowns of the kinds of articles that get stolen, but Horst says that thieves often target anything small, expensive, and that can be easily re-sold, such as perfume and cosmetics. There had also been a rise in the theft of foods, especially relatively expensive things like meats and cheeses. But Nicole Bögelein, a criminologist at Cologne University, cast doubt on how useful the study actually is. She told DW that the researchers estimate that 98% of cases aren't even discovered. So it's just an assumption that the majority of these losses can be attributed to theft, she said. Bögelein also cast doubt on the EHI's conclusion that there are more organized shoplifting gangs, as that could simply be because store detectives are more on the lookout for such groups. 'Poverty crimes' Despite its shortcomings, the annual EHI survey is one of the few shoplifting studies there are, and it is focused mostly on the economic impact. Bögelein, by training a sociologist as well as a criminologist, has a different perspective and says that almost all cases of shoplifting are so-called poverty crimes — defined as crimes that don't cost any money to carry out, and are committed by people because they have no money. Bögelein's own investigations into shoplifting have found that the people who are caught are often poor — possibly, she says, also because store detectives are more likely to keep an eye on people who look poor. Official statistics suggest that the majority of thefts from shops are relatively petty. According to German federal police statistics, in 66.7% of discovered and prosecuted thefts, the value of the items stolen was under €50 and in 40.2% of cases even under €15. The punishment is usually a small fine, or, if the fine can't or won't be paid, a prison sentence. Germany a 'paradise' for shoplifters? Horst described Germany as a paradise for shoplifters, as the punishments are often relatively mild. Though theoretically thieves can be imprisoned for up to five years, he said that in practice first-time offenders are often not charged at all. Bögelein said that deterrence might have an effect on some minor thefts, but was generally skeptical of the idea that more punishment discourages petty crime. People don't not steal because they're scared of punishment, she argued. In criminology, we find that people stick to rules because they think those rules are correct and because they fear a bad conscience if they don't stick to them. Public transport operators in Germany often charge people a fee for riding without a ticket, but may also press charges, especially for repeat offenders.Image: picture-alliance/dpa/J. Wolf Should shoplifting be decriminalized in Germany? There has been a debate among German criminologists about to what extent poverty crimes should be decriminalized altogether, on the grounds that such crimes are usually victimless and therefore don't require criminal justice. There have long been calls to downgrade one classic poverty crime — riding public transport without a ticket — to a misdemeanor, partly because punishing it has become a burden to public coffers and is clogging up the justice system. Between 8,000 and 9,000 people end up in prison in Germany every year for riding without a ticket. But Horst argued that shoplifting shouldn't always be defined as a poverty crime: The EHI estimates that two-thirds of shoplifting cases were what he called opportunistic perpetrators, and many of them are not necessarily poor. Horst does think that inflation and higher prices for basic items may be playing a role in the rise of shoplifting, but he was reluctant to accept that poverty was the driving element of all theft. It could be a protest theft, because people are saying they're not prepared to accept the price rises for a particular product, he said, I'm sure poverty is a part of it, but that it explains the rise on its own — I don't see that.

The latest study by Germany's Retail Institute (EHI) on inventory differences shows that the vast majority of those losses (€4.2 billion) was down to theft from customers, employees, or delivery workers, the EHI said, which would mean losses of some €570 million to the public purse through lost sales tax. The EHI also said that retailers had to resort to balancing out their losses and the costs of extra security by increasing prices. Study author Frank Horst calculated that some 1.5% of prices in stores could now be attributed to covering theft and security. Shoplifting techniques The EHI said there had also been a 5% increase in organized shoplifting, which accounted for a third of the total shoplifting losses. Horst said this could be individual thieves working their way through a shopping list, or else, the thefts could be carried out by coordinated groups. One of them drives a vehicle, one of them distracts the staff, or shields the one putting the goods away so they can't be seen, Horst told DW. Sometimes so-called depots are set up in the store, where all the goods are packed in a bag, and then someone else carries it out in a surreptitious moment. The survey does not include exact breakdowns of the kinds of articles that get stolen, but Horst says that thieves often target anything small, expensive, and that can be easily re-sold, such as perfume and cosmetics. There had also been a rise in the theft of foods, especially relatively expensive things like meats and cheeses. But Nicole Bögelein, a criminologist at Cologne University, cast doubt on how useful the study actually is. She told DW that the researchers estimate that 98% of cases aren't even discovered. So it's just an assumption that the majority of these losses can be attributed to theft, she said. Bögelein also cast doubt on the EHI's conclusion that there are more organized shoplifting gangs, as that could simply be because store detectives are more on the lookout for such groups. 'Poverty crimes' Despite its shortcomings, the annual EHI survey is one of the few shoplifting studies there are, and it is focused mostly on the economic impact. Bögelein, by training a sociologist as well as a criminologist, has a different perspective and says that almost all cases of shoplifting are so-called poverty crimes — defined as crimes that don't cost any money to carry out, and are committed by people because they have no money. Bögelein's own investigations into shoplifting have found that the people who are caught are often poor — possibly, she says, also because store detectives are more likely to keep an eye on people who look poor. Official statistics suggest that the majority of thefts from shops are relatively petty. According to German federal police statistics, in 66.7% of discovered and prosecuted thefts, the value of the items stolen was under €50 and in 40.2% of cases even under €15. The punishment is usually a small fine, or, if the fine can't or won't be paid, a prison sentence. Germany a 'paradise' for shoplifters? Horst described Germany as a paradise for shoplifters, as the punishments are often relatively mild. Though theoretically thieves can be imprisoned for up to five years, he said that in practice first-time offenders are often not charged at all. Bögelein said that deterrence might have an effect on some minor thefts, but was generally skeptical of the idea that more punishment discourages petty crime. People don't not steal because they're scared of punishment, she argued. In criminology, we find that people stick to rules because they think those rules are correct and because they fear a bad conscience if they don't stick to them. Public transport operators in Germany often charge people a fee for riding without a ticket, but may also press charges, especially for repeat offenders.Image: picture-alliance/dpa/J. Wolf Should shoplifting be decriminalized in Germany? There has been a debate among German criminologists about to what extent poverty crimes should be decriminalized altogether, on the grounds that such crimes are usually victimless and therefore don't require criminal justice. There have long been calls to downgrade one classic poverty crime — riding public transport without a ticket — to a misdemeanor, partly because punishing it has become a burden to public coffers and is clogging up the justice system. Between 8,000 and 9,000 people end up in prison in Germany every year for riding without a ticket. But Horst argued that shoplifting shouldn't always be defined as a poverty crime: The EHI estimates that two-thirds of shoplifting cases were what he called opportunistic perpetrators, and many of them are not necessarily poor. Horst does think that inflation and higher prices for basic items may be playing a role in the rise of shoplifting, but he was reluctant to accept that poverty was the driving element of all theft. It could be a protest theft, because people are saying they're not prepared to accept the price rises for a particular product, he said, I'm sure poverty is a part of it, but that it explains the rise on its own — I don't see that.

Why is there a market for her content in the Balkan country and how are some Bulgarians fighting it?https://p.dw.com/p/4vrvKOn her social media profiles, Bulgarian influencer Zornitsa Gyutsova posts misogynistic advice about how men should 'deal with' womenImage: Zgyutsova/TikTokAdvertisement Women love men who can be violent if need be. That's why they like men who hit them, Bulgarian influencer Zornitsa Gyutsova tells her followers. Gyutsova suggests that not only do women prefer men who physically assault them, but that this is also the way men should behave because a woman should respect a man's physical power since she is unable to comprehend his intellectual power. This is the kind of advice that can be found on Gyutsova's social media profiles and in a private group founded by her on Telegram called Upstanding Man. 'Equality is contrary to human nature' Zornitsa Gyutsova offers her followers private chats over video where she teaches them how to deal with women — for a fee, of course. Many influencers, life coaches and other online personalities in Bulgaria and elsewhere offer private sessions or courses. What makes Gyutsova's content stand out from the rest is that its sole purpose is to explain to men that they need to learn to control their partners both psychologically and, if necessary, physically.There have been numerous protests against violence against women in Bulgaria in recent years, such as this one in 2023Image: Alexandar Detev/DW In Gyutsova's view, men in general have been treated badly by women, and women are the ones who exert violence on men, namely by not paying them enough respect. The idea of equality is like a worm in people's brains that insists men and women should be partners […] which is so contrary to human nature that it can never work, Gyutsova declared in a long video about her work that was broadcast on Bulgarian National Television. Although the broadcaster, which is partly financed by taxpayer's money, has since removed the video from its platforms, it has never publicly commented on the case. Huge backlash Gyutsova's profiles on social media have been gaining traction for several years now. Screenshots and videos from her private Telegram group chat recently surfaced on social media, triggering a huge backlash in Bulgaria. Local woman Petya Krasteva was so appalled by Gyutsova's online content that she filed a complaint against Gyutsova with the prosecutor's office. On her social media channels, she not only encourages people to degrade women and use violence against them, she also boasts that she uses the same methods on her child and her cat, she told DW. I thought to myself: This is not only absolutely unacceptable, it's criminal. Gender discrimination not a crime in Bulgaria Many other women did the same as Krasteva, only to find out a couple of weeks later that their efforts had been in vain.Petya Krasteva was appalled by Zornitsa Gyutsova's online content and filed a complaint against her with the prosecutor's officeImage: Nikola Gyulmezov In an official reply, the prosecutor's office stated that nothing could be done because Bulgaria's criminal code does not define gender discrimination as a crime and that the issue was a matter for the Commission against Discrimination. Krasteva promptly lodged a complaint with this commission, but received another negative answer based on the same reasoning. Profiles briefly taken down Although these complaints did not lead to charges being brought against Gyutsova, the backlash did have an impact. The outcry and the fact that Gyutsova's social media accounts were reported by people who found their content abhorrent, meant that the influencer's TikTok and Instagram profiles were deactivated. They were, however, reactivated a short time later. Impunity for abusers Krasteva feels that part of the reason why content like Gyutsova's strikes a chord in Bulgaria is that while patriarchal norms and domestic violence are not accepted in the country, Bulgarian society often turns a blind eye to them. The other huge problem, she says, is that as with many other social issues, there is a complete lack of consequences for the perpetrators. Valentina Dimitrova, a psychologist who works for the Emprove Foundation, a Bulgarian organization that supports women who have suffered domestic violence, holds a similar view.Psychologist Valentina Dimitrova says that content like Gyutsova's is dangerous because 'it can truly cost a human life'Image: Venera Velkovska Sadly it's embedded in the Bulgarian mindset that we often just accept that things are bad and we do nothing about it, says Dimitrova. She believes that this is also why many women stay in violent relationships: They simply have no faith in the authorities because time and time again, men who beat or even kill their partners face no legal consequences. Although some people seem to think that social media content is less problematic than actual abuse in real life, Dimitrova stresses the dangers associated with such content: It can truly cost a human life. A global online problem Misogynistic online content that paints women as lesser human beings and men as oppressed by women is not unique to Bulgaria. Such content has been growing and spreading all over the world in recent years. Influencers like Andrew Tate, who faces charges of rape, bodily harm, human trafficking and more, have created a whole movement around this sort of content. Gyutsova fits neatly into this category of influencer, but what makes her different is that she is a woman. What role does feminism play? Dimitrova thinks one issue here is that feminism is often misunderstood. Feminism does not entail men being suppressed and women controlling them. It means that women can have equal rights and can function as equals to men not only in society but also in their personal relationships, she says. Dimitrova also believes that the patriarchal notion that men should not be allowed to express emotions is highly problematic. This is reflected in Gyutsova's content, which suggests that men are weak and not manly if they dare to express their fears, emotions or feelings.People in Sofia attend a protest against domestic violence and violence against women in Bulgaria in 2023 after a young woman was stabbed by her ex-partner Image: Alexandar Detev/DW It's a vicious circle: Men who are not allowed to express any sort of emotion for fear of being labeled weak don't know what to do when they experience something frustrating in their relationships and so they resort to aggression, says Dimitrova. What can be done? Dimitrova suggests that first and foremost, men should receive support and their concerns should not just be swept under the carpet. She stresses, however, that this support should not validate the inclination to deal with problems by exerting psychological or physical violence on women. Although the Emprove Foundation focuses primarily on women's rights and issues, it does have a project that focuses on men's mental health — something the foundation says is incredibly important in the fight against gender-based violence. Men should be encouraged to connect to a healthy understanding of themselves, so they can build healthy relationships as well, says Dimitrova. Petya Krasteva firmly believes that even though authorities in Bulgaria rarely provide the support needed in cases like this, society should not remain indifferent. We should be as loud as possible when something like this turns up, she says. We should be perfectly clear that it is unacceptable. That way, other people who come across this content will know that this is not something that society approves of, and that could help them realize that they shouldn't have anything to do with it. Dimitrova agrees. We will keep talking about it [this kind of content], calling it out and not tolerating it until the authorities wake up.

The list includes not only Myanmar's military leader Min Aung Hlaing, but also former State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and former President Htin Kyaw. Suu Kyi effectively served as Myanmar's top civilian leader before the military staged a coup in February 2021. She has been imprisoned ever since. The court in Argentina claims it has the jurisdiction to order a warrant for Suu Kyi's arrest based on a legal principle that some serious crimes can be prosecuted regardless of where they were committed. The specific case focuses on discrimination against Myanmar's Rohingya ethnic minority. The Muslim Rohingya live predominantly in the western state of Rakhine, and their status as citizens and as an ethnic group recognized by the state of Myanmar has been disputed for decades. The Rohingya crisis of 2017 Since 1988, Myanmar has seen an ongoing political conflict between the military and military-backed parties on one side and Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, on the other. In 2016, after many years of stalemate, the military and Aung San Suu Kyi reached a truce. A kind of dual government was established, with Aung San Suu Kyi heading the civilian branch and Min Aung Hlaing heading the military, which had constitutionally secured independence and far-reaching political rights. On October 9, 2016, Rohingya insurgents attacked several border and police posts of the Myanmar security forces. In August 2017, the security forces launched so-called clearance operations. As a result, thousands of Rohingya were killed and around 700,000 fled to neighboring Bangladesh, with exact figures still unclear due to the nature of the ethnically-charged conflict. Rohingya refugees fear increased hardship due to aid cutsTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video While the military denied using excessive force, international watchdogs and the UN agree that Myanmar's actions against the Rohingya constitute grave human rights violations. Still, two questions remain: First, did the offensive amount to genocide? Second, how much of it was the responsibility of Aung San Suu Kyi? The question of genocide Concerns that a genocide was happening in Myanmar have already been voiced before 2017. In 2015, the human rights organization Fortify Rights published a report with the Allard K. Lovenstein International Human Rights Clinic from Yale Law School in which was stated that there is strong evidence that genocide is being committed against Rohingya. Those voices only grew louder after 2017, and in November 2019, Gambia initiated a case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Myanmar, claiming violations of the UN's Genocide Convention. The ICJ has yet to rule on the case, however, meaning that the existence of genocide remains unconfirmed in a legal sense. But for human rights organizations like Fortify Rights, the Burmese-Rohingya Organization UK (BROUK) and the former UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar, Tomas Ojea Quintana, there is no doubt that genocide did take place. Quintana, an Argentinian, told Radio Free Asia that the court in his native country understood what was at stake, which is the genocide against the Rohingya people. The question of responsibility Aung San Suu Kyi was a globally renowned human rights advocate since the early 1990s until the events of 2017. She was also heading Myanmar's civilian government during the deadly wave of violence against the Rohingya. As chief councilor, she was notably hesitant to speak out against the military and even went to The Hague in 2019 to defend Myanmar at the International Court of Justice. She denied genocide was happening in Rakhine but admitted human rights violations, which would be investigated by Myanmar. She later confirmed this position in an interview with the Financial Times. War crimes were committed during the internal armed conflict with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army by members of Myanmar's security forces and civilians, she told the paper. At the same time, Aung San Suu Kyi pointed to a report by the Independent Commission of Enquiry (ICOE) which was set up by Myanmar without Rohingya representatives. The ICOE found no evidence of genocide, she told the paper, despite its report recording killing of civilians, disproportionate use of force, looting of property, and destruction of abandoned homes of Muslims. For those who believe Myanmar troops committed genocide against the Rohingya, Aung San Suu Kyi's refusal to recognize it makes her complicit. But does her stance — admitting that human rights violations happened but not genocide — mean Aung San Suu Kyi is guilty of committing genocide? What do we know about the Argentinian court order? The reasons behind the Argentinian court's decision to seek an international arrest warrant are not fully clear, as neither the ruling nor the exact evidence on which the ruling was based are publicly available. DW contacted the Argentinian court and the Argentinian human rights commission to get more information in the matter, but received no reply. The 2021 coup triggered protests in Myanmar, which eventually escalated into a civil war.Image: Sai Aung Main/AFP In the months following the announcement, Myanmar expert and former ambassador Derek Tonkin published an academic paper on the issue, examining the sources which most likely led to the arrest warrant. He writes that the petition [on which the decision of the court seems to be based] contains much narrative and opinion which are debatable and questionable, and in some areas are simply wrong. Commenting on the claim that Aung San Suu Kyi and others validated the genocide against the Rohingya, Tonkin states, it is not true and is supported by no evidence anywhere in the petition. Tonkin also rejects the accusation that Aung San Suu Kyi was directly responsible for the events in Rakhine State during her time as state counsellor at the time. I find this totally unconvincing. The Tatmadaw [the Myanmar military] refused to accept Aung San Suu Kyi's appointment, he writes. So far, the arrest warrant hasn't had any impact. Aung San Suu Kyi seems set to celebrate her 80th birthday next month as a prisoner in Myanmar as the civil war rages on. With the passage of time, the international arrest warrant might end up as a mere footnote in a long political career filled with legal battles.

Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Mohali Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Harmandeep Singh Hans, said several special teams were constituted to trace the rising number of heinous crimes in the district. The operation was led by SP (Operations) Talwinder Singh, SP (PBI) Deepika Singh, DSP (City-2) Harsimran Singh Bal, and DSP (Economic Offences) Rajesh. Under this operation SHO Amandeep Singh and inspectors Gabbar Singh and Gagandeep carried out an investigation based on an FIR registered on July 12. According to the complainant, the incident occurred during the night of July 11–12, when she was returning from Best Tech Mall after watching a movie with her friend. Near Lakhnour turn, four bike-borne youths, dressed in Nihang attire, intercepted their car. The miscreants forcibly dragged her out of the vehicle and kidnapped her friend before fleeing the scene in the stolen car, the complaint stated. The SSP said that after assaulting the kidnapped boy, the accused threw him about 100 meters away. They then fled with the girl, kept her with them for approximately 30 minutes and later pushed her out near a gate before escaping towards Ambala. SSP Hans identified the arrested accused as Shamsher Singh, a resident of Gurdaspur; Satnam Singh (from Ludhiana), who works as a cab driver; Nirmal Singh (Nawanshahr), employed as a security guard; and Chander Mohan, alias Jaildar (Jammu), who also works as a security guard, All four were residing at a PG located behind Gurdwara Singh Shaheedan, Sohana in Mohali. Acting on a tip-off, police put the entire district on high alert. Multiple teams were deployed and after analysing the CCTV footage, the stolen vehicle was successfully traced. The accused were arrested from Chanarthal village under Sahabad police station, and the looted car was recovered. “These accused may be involved in other criminal cases as well. Interrogation is underway, and more revelations are expected,” Hans added.",7f251a7091a932c843ffae68035733e3ed5734782bce2e0aba302a91473a43d5,e9ffc2dbb5d1b5a0c5b8fd59dc708464

Sanjay Verma was shot dead on Monday at around 10 am, right outside his showroom in Abohar. According to eyewitnesses, three motorcycle-borne assailants lay in wait for him. The moment Verma stepped out of his car, they opened indiscriminate fire, killing him on the spot before fleeing the scene. While the shooters escaped and have yet to be identified, the Punjab Police announced the arrest of two of their accomplices, Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan, both residents of Patiala district, for helping the shooters escape in the car. However, within hours, both men were killed in a police encounter. This development has added fuel to the controversy. BJP General Secretary Manjinder Singh Sirsa accused the Punjab government of mishandling the law and order situation. On his visit to Chandigarh Wednesday, Sirsa said, “First of all, the Punjab government is not able to control the law and order and criminals… Punjab has become a police state. If Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has a clean image, he should get a CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) inquiry conducted into these encounters so the truth comes out.” Reacting sharply, AAP’s Punjab state president Aman Arora called the BJP’s stance “extremely shameful,” accusing it of siding with gangsters instead of supporting Verma’s bereaved family. Arora said, “While the entire Punjab stands with the family of Shri Sanjay Verma, Manjinder Singh Sirsa’s open support for gangsters today proves that the BJP is backing criminals even through central jails.” After meeting the family of Sanjay Verma on Monday, Arora had stated that gangsters lodged in jails outside Punjab were behind such heinous criminal activities. Whereas, Union Minister of State Ravneet Singh Bittu held the Mann government responsible for the ‘growing fear and lawlessness’ across Punjab. “Instead of owning up to their failure, AAP leaders are shamelessly pointing fingers at the Centre. This is not governance –it’s a complete abdication of duty,” he added. Bittu called Arora’s remarks “irresponsible” and “highly condemnable,” accusing him of trying to deflect attention from the AAP government’s failure to maintain law and order in the state. In a statement released on Monday, Bittu announced that he would write to the Governor of Punjab, urging him to take cognisance of Arora’s “baseless allegations”. He also sought written clarifications from Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav and Chief Secretary KAP Sinha, questioning whether Arora’s statement reflected the official position of the Bhagwant Mann-led government. “Aman Arora’s claim that gangster Lawrence Bishnoi is safe in Gujarat under the Centre’s protection is nothing but an excuse to hide the AAP government’s incompetence. These kinds of inflammatory and misleading remarks are both dangerous and unacceptable,” said Bittu. He reaffirmed that the central government has always taken a tough stance against terrorism and organised crime. “We conducted surgical strikes inside Pakistan when needed. Do you think gangsters are beyond our reach? Once the BJP forms government in Punjab, we’ll show what decisive action really looks like,” Bittu said. Pointing to the killing of Sanjay Verma, Bittu accused the Punjab government of completely surrendering to the gangster nexus. “Extortion threats and targeted killings have become the new normal for Punjab’s business community,” he said. Adding to the political slugfest, AAP’s Abohar constituency in-charge Arun Narang displayed a photo showing Abohar MLA Sandeep Jakhar with Shakti, a bike driver allegedly linked to the murder. Sandeep Jakhar, who is a suspended Congress MLA and nephew of Punjab BJP chief Sunil Jakhar, clarified that the picture was from the 2022 assembly election campaign. “Many people get pictures taken with us during campaigns. It’s illogical to link that picture to this crime,” he said. ‘We have full trust’ Jagat Verma, elder brother of Sanjay Verma, has expressed satisfaction over the police probe. In a video, Jagat Verma said, “We have full trust in the Punjab Police and we are satisfied with the ongoing police investigation. We humbly appeal to one and all to please stop doing politics over this issue. We appeal to the police to nab the rest of the culprits soon… We trust that we will get justice soon.” State of probe The police said their investigations have revealed that the getaway bike was driven by one Shakti, a daily wager from Azimgarh village of Abohar. While escaping, the attackers lost control of their bike and forcibly snatched another two-wheeler. They later abandoned it on Seeto Road and allegedly fled in a waiting Swift car, driven by Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan. Jaspreet Singh’s family has denied any involvement, alleging that he was picked up from his house in Mardankheri village of Patiala during the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday, and that they later received news of his death. They maintain that Jaspreet was a daily wager with no criminal background. The police said Jaspreet had a criminal background, and released a few pictures of him brandishing weapons. The details of his criminal record haven’t been revealed as of now. At the time of filing this report, the postmortem examination of Jaspreet and Ram was underway at the Abohar Civil Hospital under strict police cover. Meanwhile, gangster Aarzoo Bishnoi had claimed responsibility for the murder on social media, tagging Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar and Maharashtra’s Shivam Lonker hours after the murder. After the alleged encounter, Bishnoi again posted that the real shooters remained at large, and that Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan had no role in the killing. The Punjab unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has identified the Lawrence Bishnoi gang as the perpetrators behind this crime. The police, however, have not confirmed these claims nor provided clarity on the identities of the actual shooters.",e5f95abfc958db5d8cdbca385844d557be4c91c691308cd7d60da76720ec2964,110f9aeaaf40f7b999bac5a862114640

Their online conversations quickly grew into what seemed like a genuine relationship, and soon, talks of marriage followed. But the connection, which appeared to promise a shared future, turned out to be an elaborate cyber scam in which he was allegedly duped of a staggering Rs 1.55 crore over eight months. The investigation revealed that the cybercriminals, operating behind the profile of ‘Anamika,’ gradually gained the complainant’s trust and allegedly requested large sums of money. On the pretence of building a future together, ‘Anamika’ allegedly convinced him to transfer funds to purchase a house without ever having met. Over time, the scammers further manipulated him into investing in various trading apps, luring him with promises of exceptionally high returns, said the police. After spending nearly all his life savings and facing further demands for more money, he realised he had been deceived. When he tried to recover his funds, ‘Anamika’ allegedly abruptly stopped all communication with him. The police filed an FIR in March based on his complaint. The investigation by the cybercrime police station in Pimpri Chinchwad unearthed an elaborate network of mule account handlers allegedly operating from Solapur and with links to cybercriminals masterminding these scams from China. The police zeroed in on one particular mule account registered in Solapur in June. As the account holder was questioned, he spilled the beans on three others from Solapur who had allegedly told him that his bank account would be used for taking funds obtained from gaming applications. As the investigation dug deeper into these three suspects, the police established their identities and roles in the racket. The mule account handlers from Solapur have been identified as Shubham Chandrakant Mantha, 25, a resident of Ashok Chowk; Swapnil Chandulal Baheti, 35, a resident of Hotgi Road; and Prashik Uttam Navghare, 26, a resident of Juna Kumbhani Naka. “Our investigation revealed that Mantha worked for a China-headquartered payment application company, and he and Baheti were in direct contact with the masterminds based out of China. A coordinated search operation was launched for the trio as their roles were confirmed in the probe,” an officer who was part of the probe said. In the second week of June, Mantha and Navghare were arrested from Pune International Airport when they were about to flee to Nepal via Patna. Baheti, too, was placed under arrest. “Investigation revealed an elaborate mule handling and fund siphoning operation with direct links to China,” said an officer. All three suspects are currently in judicial custody.",9865caa283c9b9ddd31c4f3ac55f1c88767cac6e0a52108d705b0426b1b3413e,d113295a560ee830400d4ef5003f9379

The victim, identified as Sanjeev, 19, a resident of Rajiv Colony, Panchkula, had reportedly come to the area to meet a friend when he was attacked. According to police officials, Sanjeev was surrounded by three to four individuals around 10.30 pm. He was stabbed multiple times in the chest and abdomen with a knife, and then left critically injured on the roadside. The assailants fled the scene immediately after the attack. Soon after, a crowd gathered at the spot, and the PCR was informed. Sanjeev was rushed to the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, Chandigarh, where he succumbed to his injuries during treatment, the police said. The Chandigarh Police have apprehended two minors in connection with the crime. “An FIR has been registered, and the two juveniles have been booked for murder. They will be sent to a juvenile home,” said Vijay Singh, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Chandigarh Police. Sources revealed that the accused allegedly attacked Sanjeev because he was reportedly stalking their sister. The police have not ruled out the involvement of more individuals and are continuing their investigation. Meanwhile, the preliminary postmortem report has stated that the victim died due to punctured vital organs caused by the stabbings. The incident has triggered tension in the area, with residents demanding increased police patrolling and swift justice. Teenager injured in stabbing attack in Sector 40 A 19-year-old teenager was critically injured in a targeted stabbing attack by a group of around half a dozen minors in Block C of Sector 40 in Chandigarh on Sunday night. The assault is suspected to be a result of personal enmity. According to the police, the attackers arrived on three to four motorbikes and were not wearing helmets. They attacked the youth and fled the scene within seconds. The victim was initially rushed by his family members to a private hospital in Mohali, but was later shifted to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, Chandigarh.

But when public figures cross legal lines, the consequences unfold not just in courtrooms but also under the relentless scrutiny of the public eye. One name that recently forced this uncomfortable truth into the spotlight is Sean “Diddy” Combs, the hip-hop mogul and music industry titan who, after years of whispers and lawsuits, has now been convicted in a federal court. In July 2025, a jury found Combs guilty on two felony counts of transportation to engage in prostitution under the Mann Act, a law dating back to 1910. These charges relate to the coerced travel of his former partner, singer Cassie Ventura, and another woman identified only as “Jane,” both of whom testified during the trial. Combs was acquitted on three other charges, including racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking. Still, the guilty verdict marks a seismic fall for the 55-year-old artist once synonymous with glamour, success, and cultural dominance. Diddy’s story is far from unique. Over the years, several A-listers have been convicted of crimes — from drug possession and assault to manslaughter and tax evasion. This listicle delves into 10 high-profile celebrities with criminal records, focusing only on those with confirmed legal outcomes. Once a towering figure in global music, Diddy’s legacy has been rocked by criminal convictions. In a 2025 federal trial, he was found guilty of two counts of transporting women – including ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura – for prostitution, under the Mann Act. Though acquitted of more serious charges like racketeering and sex trafficking, the felony convictions carry serious legal and reputational consequences. More fallout may follow. Attorney Tony Buzbee claims over 100 men and women have accused Diddy of rape and assault. One woman alleged she was gang raped at age 17 after being drugged at a 2003 party. While Combs’s team dismisses the lawsuits as publicity stunts, the convictions have added weight to the mounting allegations. Sanjay Dutt’s conviction remains one of the most talked-about legal sagas in Indian cinema. In 1993, following the devastating Mumbai bomb blasts, Dutt was arrested under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) for illegally possessing an AK-56 rifle, which was part of a consignment linked to the bombings. Though he was acquitted of terrorism charges, he was convicted in 2006 under the Arms Act for illegal possession of firearms. After years of legal proceedings and appeals, Dutt was sentenced to five years in prison and ultimately served over four years, including time at Yerwada Central Jail. Before becoming Tony Stark, Robert Downey Jr. was one of Hollywood’s most tragic cautionary tales. Struggling with addiction in the 90s, Downey was repeatedly arrested for possession of heroin, cocaine, and unlicensed firearms. He was famously found wandering into a neighbour’s house under the influence and passed out in their bed. In 1999, after multiple probation violations, he was sentenced to three years in prison, though he served roughly a year before early release. In 2009, Bollywood actor Shiney Ahuja was arrested for raping his domestic help—a case that sent shockwaves through the film industry. Though the victim later recanted her statement, the court found the original testimony credible and convicted Ahuja in 2011 under Section 376 (rape) and other charges. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, though he spent about three years in jail before being released on bail pending appeal. Wesley Snipes’ high-flying Hollywood career hit a wall when he was convicted in 2008 on three misdemeanor counts of failing to file federal income tax returns. Prosecutors claimed he hadn’t paid taxes for years, despite earning tens of millions. Though he was acquitted of the more severe felony tax fraud charges, he still served nearly three years in prison. In 1992, boxing champion Mike Tyson was convicted of raping 18-year-old Desiree Washington, a beauty pageant contestant, in an incident that took place at a hotel in Indianapolis in July 1991. The jury found Tyson guilty after about 10 hours of deliberation, rejecting his defense that the encounter was consensual. Tyson was sentenced to six years in prison and served approximately three years before being released on parole in 1995. The conviction shocked the sports world and dramatically altered Tyson’s public image overnight, marking a significant turning point in his career. Despite this setback, Tyson later returned to the boxing ring and expanded his career into entertainment, including notable acting roles such as in The Hangover film series. In 2001, Stranger Things star Winona Ryder was arrested for shoplifting over $5,500 worth of merchandise from a Beverly Hills Saks Fifth Avenue store. She was later convicted of felony grand theft and vandalism, receiving three years’ probation, 480 hours of community service, and fines. The incident damaged her career for years, leading to a hiatus from leading roles in Hollywood. Ryder eventually made a well-received comeback, and her 2000s-era troubles are now often seen as part of the conversation around mental health and celebrity pressure. Shia LaBeouf is known for his acting talent as well as his history of erratic behaviour and legal troubles. Over the years, he has been arrested multiple times for offenses such as disorderly conduct, public intoxication, and drunk driving. One of the most notable incidents occurred in 2017, when LaBeouf was arrested in Savannah, Georgia, for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. During this arrest, he was caught on camera making a racially charged outburst toward police officers. These incidents, along with other arrests for similar behavior, have contributed to his reputation for instability. LaBeouf has also faced civil lawsuits from former partners, most prominently from singer FKA Twigs, who accused him of sexual battery and emotional abuse. While he has not been criminally convicted in these civil cases, the combination of his legal issues and public controversies has overshadowed his career achievements, leading many to view him as a cautionary example of wasted potential in Hollywood. Before becoming a blockbuster actor and producer, Mark Wahlberg had a violent and troubling past. At 16, Wahlberg was charged with attempted murder after assaulting two Vietnamese men during a racially motivated attack. He was convicted of assault and served 45 days in prison. The case drew renewed attention in 2014 when Wahlberg applied for a pardon, sparking criticism from civil rights groups and raising questions about accountability and privilege. Wahlberg has publicly acknowledged his past and expressed remorse, though his request for a pardon was ultimately dropped. Phil Spector, the music genius behind the Wall of Sound, became infamous for a far more sinister reason. In 2009, he was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2003 death of actress Lana Clarkson, who was found shot in his mansion. The trial, his second, after a hung jury, ended in a conviction and a 19-years-to-life prison sentence. Spector died in custody in 2021.",73697cd66a0be055d4dc8648c5cf018f30e228abbd24ff6c1604b1ab6fa4aac5,1676ed0148c17932b20d45559413e540

The doctor received two bullet injuries, and his condition is critical, they said. Ajay Gandhi, Senior Superintendent of Police, Moga, said Dr Aniljit Kamboj, who is in his fifties, was shot at by two men who came to his Harbans Nursing Home at around 2 pm. “The doctor was treating one of them, and discussing medicines when the second man who was standing behind opened fire. Two bullets hit the doctor, including one in the chest. He has been admitted to a private hospital in Moga, and his condition is critical. He is on ventilator,” Gandhi told The Indian Express. He said the police are probing the case from all angles, and checking CCTV footage to identify the suspects. A family member told The Indian Express that Kamboj had received extortion calls from Canada-based designated terrorist Lakhbir Singh Landa, an operative of the banned organization Babbar Khalsa International (BKI). The threat calls were being received since 2022 and the caller was demanding at least Rs 1 crore, said the family member, requesting anonymity. He further said that Kamboj was also given a security cover by the Moga Police but the lone gunman was withdrawn some months ago. Moga SP (investigation) Bal Krishan Singla, said: “An FIR was registered in 2022 after Dr Kamboj had received threat calls. Landa was nominated as an accused in that FIR.

The deceased have been identified as dhaba owner Siddarodh Tugudi, 35, his nephew Jagadish Belamagi, 28, and employee Ramanna Bhosga, 40. The police said that the triple murders were in retaliation to a killing that occurred in November last year in connection with a feud between two families who belong to the same village. According to the police, Tugudi and his brothers had murdered a criminal identified as Somu Talikoti over a financial dispute and were released on bail recently. To avenge Talikot’s death, four of his brothers along with associates reportedly orchestrated Wednesday’s attack, the police said. “The police have been warning the families after the murder that took place last year. They belong to the same caste and are relatives. We suspect that these murders were carried out in revenge,” said Kalaburagi City Police Commissioner Sharanappa S D on Thursday. The assailants allegedly stormed the dhaba at 12.45 am, targeting Siddarodh and Jagadish, the police said, adding that they have recovered crucial CCTV footage from a nearby petrol station. The accused had damaged the CCTVs installed at the dhaba. “When the dhaba employees attempted to flee through the back door toward an agricultural field, the attackers pursued them.

The accused were riding a motorcycle with a temporary number plate when they were intercepted by the police. Police said that the arrests are linked to the firing incident that took place on the intervening night of June 20-21.

The accused — Sandeep Jawahar Shah, a resident of Solapur, and Salim Khubbuddin Patel, a resident of Navi Mumbai — were arrested in Mumbai and Sangli earlier this month. As per the CBI, it discovered that the two were involved in duping NEET candidates and their parents by falsely claiming to have connections with officials of the National Testing Agency (NTA) that conducts the examination. As per the CBI, Shah initially demanded Rs 90 lakh from each candidate and agreed to accept Rs 87.5 lakh per candidate. The central agency claimed that Shah and Patel would assure candidates that they would receive details of their purportedly increased marks six hours before the official declaration of results. The accused sought to be released on bail on the grounds that probe was completed and their custodial interrogation was not required. The pleas claimed that there was no recovery at the instance of the applicants and they’ll co-operate with the trial after being released on bail. The CBI, however, opposed the pleas stating that the same be rejected as there other accused persons are yet to be arrested and therefore the custodial interrogation of present applicants would be required. However, special judge VP Desai observed that till date (on June 21) “the investigating officer has nothing concrete to show that till what period the other accused will be arrested”. Merely because the other accused persons are yet to be arrested cannot be a ground for rejection of the bail, the judge added. The court further noted that offence under section 7(A) of Prevention of the Corruption (PC) Act is not punishable in imprisonment of life or death and punishment prescribed is not less than three years but will extend to seven years. “Nothing is brought on record against the applicant that he will not be available for trial. Hence discretion in the nature of bail can be exercised in the favour of applicants,” the court held and granted bail to the two on furnishing personal bond of Rs 50,000 each along with other terms and conditions.",4974f52e05170329fc61b34918e72435efd9c5cfb80bb908d716d1ecea37e141,772d6209c825a13e8bd82758db7362e1

NCRB 2015; PhD Scholar,murder,India; AI; Dalit; the United States; Chicago,the 18th century; working hours; 2019; the 1980s; 2018; 2022,,,,,,,"How AI in criminal justice could spark a human rights crisis for the marginalised Written by Roshan Pandey and Chetna Trivedi We are living in the era commonly referred to as Industry 4.0, where artificial intelligence and information technology are becoming part of almost every aspect of life. From education and healthcare to agriculture and criminal justice, governments around the world, including India, are using AI-based technologies with the claim of improving governance, efficiency and transparency. The purpose of technology, ideally, is to improve human life. But an important question remains: Who controls this technology? History reminds us that technological advancement does not automatically translate into better socio-economic conditions. For instance, when the steam engine was invented in the 18th century, it sparked a massive increase in industrial productivity. Logically, this should have reduced working hours and given people more leisure time. On the contrary, working conditions for labourers worsened. This contradiction occurred because the benefits of technology are controlled by the corporate class, who use it to extract labour without improving the workers’ well-being. The same pattern could repeat itself with AI, if we fail to examine “who” shapes and benefits from its development. AI and society: Shaped by bias AI in its current form reflects existing social biases — caste, gender, religion, skin colour, language, and region. A 2019 Guardian report found women are 47 per cent more likely to be seriously injured and 17 per cent more likely to die in car crashes, as cars and their safety systems are designed for male bodies. Sociologists Donald MacKenzie and Judy Wajcman introduced the concept of the “social shaping of technology (SST)” in the 1980s. The SST argues that technology is not neutral. It is influenced by the social, political, and economic environments in which it is developed. A 2018 MIT study found facial recognition systems had a 0.8 per cent error rate for White men, but 34.7 per cent for dark-skinned women. UN Women warns AI can amplify stereotypes across areas like hiring and healthcare. Studies show AI is not neutral and biased data harms marginalised groups. In criminal justice, this could trigger serious human rights issues. Who represents India’s database? In India, there is no specific legal framework to regulate the use of AI. Yet tools are being widely adopted by both government and private institutions. Large language models and generative AI systems operate on existing datasets, but these datasets themselves are shaped by unequal access. The CSDS 2019 report pointed out a deep digital divide in India. A significant part of the population, especially women, Dalits, Adivasis, minorities, and rural communities — has limited or no access to the Internet. Oxfam’s India Inequality Report 2022 found that women use the Internet 33 per cent less than men. Only 31 per cent of rural Indians are online, compared to 67 per cent in urban areas. The situation is even more skewed when it comes to caste, with “upper” caste people having far more representation in digital spaces than Dalits and Adivasis. This means that the data on which AI systems in India are trained does not fairly represent the country’s social reality. As a result, AI tools built on such biased datasets risk reinforcing existing inequalities. AI in criminal justice: A threat to the marginalised? The NCRB’s Prison Statistics 2018 reveals deep inequalities in India’s justice system: Two-thirds of prisoners are Dalits, Adivasis, or OBCs, 19 per cent are Muslim, and 66 per cent are illiterate or have not studied beyond class X. NCRB 2015 data shows over 55 per cent of undertrials come from Dalit, Adivasi, or Muslim backgrounds. This raises concerns about using AI in criminal justice, as biased data can reinforce existing discrimination. Recent examples highlight these risks. The Punjab and Haryana High Court used ChatGPT in a bail rejection for a murder case, setting a troubling precedent. Amazon’s 2014 AI hiring tool, scrapped for bias against women, shows how AI can replicate past injustices. In India, where power in government, corporates, and media is concentrated among the privileged, AI in recruitment and policing without ethical safeguards could further marginalise vulnerable communities. Experts often argue that developed countries possess more advanced AI systems to control crime, whereas developing nations lack the tangible and human resources needed to use such technologies effectively. However, even in the United States, AI-driven systems have demonstrated significant flaws. For instance, the COMPAS algorithm used in the criminal justice system has been shown to be twice as likely to assign higher risk scores to Black defendants compared to White defendants charged with similar offenses. Similarly, the NAACP has raised concerns on the Chicago crime prediction algorithm and its inherent systemic bias against Black communities. These examples highlight the misuse of AI-based technologies that disproportionately affect marginalised groups and violate their human rights. The central government in India is increasingly deploying tech-based tools in the criminal justice system. Notable initiatives include the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS), a nationwide database of crimes and offenders; the Inter-operable Criminal Justice System (ICJS), which enables information sharing among various state institutions; and the National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS), designed to assist in identifying suspects and missing persons. However, the use of such systems in the absence of a well-defined legal and regulatory framework raises concerns. These measures may reinforce systemic bias and lead to further marginalisation of communities that already lack adequate representation and voice within institutional records. The need for inclusive and ethical technology India holds enormous diversity but also deep inequalities. The databases currently used in AI development do not reflect the complexities of Indian society. While AI has many exciting possibilities, it also raises serious ethical and social questions that must be addressed before it is adopted widely. Therefore, the government must enact regulations to ensure AI remains inclusive, transparent, and accountable. Technology must not reinforce existing stigmas and exclusion and rather become a tool for empowerment. AI’s development should be centred around the needs of the marginalised communities to ensure equitable progress.

Police in Gaza were perplexed when he emerged as a top gang leader. The security source told The New Arab that Abu Shabab is 35 years old, thin, weak, short [around 150 centimetres tall], uncharismatic, illiterate, has strabismus in one eye, and has never received military training, he said. To them, he didn't seem like someone with the leadership skills necessary to form a group of 300 armed militants, steal truckloads of aid, and store it under the radar. The UN says Yasser Abu Shabab's gang has been raiding aid trucks with the apparent indifference or protection of the Israeli military. (Supplied: Facebook)Israeli media have reported Abu Shabab escaped from jail with Israeli assistance early in the war. He was in a Hamas prison until October 2023 for theft and drug offences, and his release came under the cover of an Israeli attack on security facilities in the Strip at the beginning of the war. From that moment on, his name emerged as someone who would fill the security vacuum in eastern Rafah, the Israeli newspaper Maariv wrote.The United Nations has identified Abu Shabab's gang as one of those raiding aid convoys when they entered Gaza, saying they were doing so with the apparent protection or indifference of the Israeli military.Former French diplomat Jean-Pierre Filliu, who spent one month in Gaza with Doctors Without Borders from December 2024 to January 2025, said he witnessed the gang being protected by the IDF while looting trucks. The Israeli military recognised its inability to promote a clan-based alternative to Hamas and decided to rely more or less openly on organised crime, he wrote in Le Monde. The key figure in this manoeuvre was a previously minor member of a Rafah family, Yasser Abu Shabab, whom Hamas had imprisoned in the past for his various trafficking activities. But Israeli protection allowed Abu Shabab to substantially expand its activities and poach, from other clans, some 100 loyalists ready for anything, often ex-convicts. What could only be called a gang operated under the eyes of the Israeli army … and it was equipped with brand-new weapons, an irrefutable indication of its collaboration with the occupiers. The Netzarim Corridor, where many of the aid gangs lurk, separates northern Gaza from the south and was cleared of buildings by the Israeli military. (Supplied via Reuters: Planet Labs Inc)Gangs taking whatever they canA gang member confirmed to the ABC that Abu Shabab's group had been stealing and selling aid. People would work normally with Yasser just like employees. He had two shifts. It was easy, the gang member said. We used to stand by the roadside to wait for trucks from Gaza to Kerem Shalom. I would take whatever I could — flour, sugar, anything we needed. The man explained that much of the looted food was then sold to merchants, although he insisted aid groups were given some of it. They would unload the goods, and traders would come to buy them. Half of the supplies were distributed to institutions like schools, he said. The aid agency would arrive to collect its share and then distribute it to schools. Abu Shabab's gang call themselves the Anti-Terror Service or the Popular Forces . (ABC News)The gang member alleged Hamas had previously been stealing some aid, something the group denies. He [Yasser] was working in security when he saw the government and Hamas members stealing from the aid trucks as they passed through central Gaza and Nuseirat, he told the ABC. That's when he decided to take action — stealing the trucks to distribute some of the aid himself, handing out money, flour … and that was it. Abu Shabab and his men, now calling themselves the Anti-Terror Service or the Popular Forces , have been accused by many Gazans of working with the Israeli government.The Israeli government has said openly it has backed groups like the one Abu Shabab runs.Hamas fighters have clashed with members of Abu Shabab's gang. (ABC News)Netanyahu arms 'clans' in GazaIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted in June that his government had activated clans in Gaza opposed to Hamas.That sparked concerns from the opposition that their weapons could eventually be turned on the IDF, or used to create unmanageable chaos. In consultation with security officials, we made use of clans in Gaza that are opposed to Hamas, he said in a video on social media. What's wrong with that? It saves the lives of IDF soldiers. The Times of Israel said Defence officials had confirmed Mr Netanyahu was referring to the Abu Shabab gang. The sources confirmed that Israel has been arming the gang with Kalashnikov rifles, including some that were seized from Hamas during the ongoing war, it wrote on June 5.Palestinians guard trucks carrying aid into the north of Gaza from the Israeli-controlled Zikim crossing. (AFP: Bashar Taleb)Former Israeli defence minister Avigdor Lieberman has alleged Abu Shabab had ties to the IS terrorist group. The Israeli government is giving weapons to a group of criminals and felons, identified with Islamic State, at the direction of the prime minister, he told Israeli public radio.The Abu Shabab group was alleged to be providing security for the new, Israeli and US-backed food distribution operation, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.It denied any links with the gang. GHF has no association with Yasser or the 'Anti-Terror Service', it said in a statement sent to the ABC.Grave concerns over Gaza aid planPhoto shows A boy holds up a jar on the back of a truckAs Gazans approach starvation, Israel's government has stopped the United Nations and other agencies from distributing food in Gaza and replaced them with a mysterious new contractor.Hamas fighters have attacked the group, but said Israeli forces came to its defence, Israeli media reported. The arrival of the new aid operation has changed conditions in the south of Gaza, but Hamas is still keen to kill or imprison Abu Shabab again.On July 2, the Hamas-controlled Interior Ministry in Gaza gave Abu Shabab 10 days to surrender himself and face trial for treason.The ABC called and sent messages to Yasser Abu Shabab but did not receive a response.Comment has also been sought from the Israeli government and the IDF.Meanwhile, the Israeli government and military continue to dismiss United Nations reports of a worsening hunger crisis in Gaza.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is only distributing food parcels at limited locations in southern and central Gaza.Israel's government last month stopped allowing food shipments into the north.The men who block the roads are still waiting by the aid routes, hoping for any chance to seize supplies and stay alive.The UN says the hunger crisis in Gaza is worsening.

Miss, he said, after the woman — assuming it was a phone number from a love struck businessman — dropped the note unread into her purse. You’d better look at that note. I have a bomb. For good measure, he opened the briefcase to show her several red cylinders, connected by a wire.Cooper wanted $US200,000 ($305,910), an amount equal to $US1,591,781 ($2,434,697) in today's currency.He wanted it in a knapsack by 5pm. He also wanted two sets of parachutes — implying he intended to take a hostage.The plane would land at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and there the money would be brought aboard, Cooper told the flight crew.Then, and only then, would the 35 passengers be free to go.A leap from a plane launches a decades-long FBI manhuntUltimately the plane circled Seattle for two hours — during that time, many passengers later told media they didn’t even know what was going on.Richard Simmons, head of a prisoner-rehabilitation program, told reporters he slept most of the time we were up there . I saw one stewardess answer a call and her face dropped, he said. She looked bewildered and gulped. I guess she learned what was happening then. His wife, Barbara, worried they may have gotten on the wrong plane. First we went right past Seattle, then Everett, she said. All I could think of was the plane was going to Vancouver and we were on the wrong flight. On the ground, the FBI and the Seattle Police Department rushed to get the money, parachutes, and emergency personnel ready for the landing.The plane landed at 5.46pm, and the money was handed over by an airport staffer — 10,000 unmarked $20 bills in a cloth bag.The passengers got off. The flight attendants retrieved the parachutes. He told them he didn’t need the instructions on how to use them.The plane took off again a few hours later with only Cooper and the flight crew aboard, followed by three fighter jets.This time it was heading for Mexico City, but the hijacker would not make it that far.The black tie DB Cooper left behind on the plane he hijacked. (Supplied: FBI)As the plane travelled somewhere between Seattle and Reno around 8pm, Cooper ordered the flight attendants to open the staircase at the back of the plane.Then he tied the bag of money around his waist, donned his parachutes, and jumped.It was the end of the hijacking, but only the beginning of an investigation that would continue for decades.Suspects, interviews and a $30,000 hoax The new files released this month are the latest in a series to be declassified under the Trump administration.The first lot of more than 400 pages were published online in March.Bundles of crumbling $20 bills from DB Cooper's ransom money were unearthed by a small boy on a sandbar in the Columbia River in 1980. (Supplied: FBI)The documents, at times heavily redacted, outline leads and suspects pursued by the FBI over the years.At one point, a man in a wheelchair became their key suspect, only to be ruled out. It is believed that the hijacker in this case has full use of all of his extremities and witnesses did not tell of any physical disability, the agent wrote. A man confined to a wheel chair [sic] did not hijack the plane in this case. Other men investigated included former pilots and members of multiple different skydiving clubs who bore a resemblance to Cooper.Men who did not resemble the artist’s sketch but who had mentioned different ways to hijack an airplane or suggested the way to hijack [and] escape would be … using a parachute were also reported to police.Several documents include long and redacted lists of suspects whose photographs were shown to witnesses without success.A contributing editor for Newsweek magazine, Karl Fleming, told the FBI he had placed an ad in multiple newspapers asking DB Cooper to contact him.Heists that shocked the worldThe plane hijacking by DB Cooper is just one of a series of high-profile robberies which have hit the headlines around the world.The ad included his home phone number.He said he had been contacted and met multiple times with a man who identified himself as Cooper.At one point, he said he had been shown several $20 bills he said he was 98 per cent positive matched copies of the ransom money shown to him by an unknown source.He handed over $US30,000 ($45,810) for the exclusive interview, publishing a three-part series detailing Cooper’s side of the story.Two men were later convicted and sentenced to serve time in federal prison for impersonating Cooper and pocketing the money.The rest of the files do not draw any definitive conclusion.'DB Cooper, Where Are You?' In the years since the hijacking, the story has become part of American pop culture history.By 1972, T-shirts bearing the phrase DB Cooper, Where Are You? were already appearing in novelty shops across the west coast.A magazine cover featuring DB Cooper published in 1976, included in National Archives files. (National Archives)There have been dozens of fiction and non-fiction books about the case, as well as references in film and television.In David Lynch’s 1990 TV series Twin Peaks, the main character is named Dale Bartholomew Cooper — a nod to the now infamous hijacker.More recently, DB Cooper was revealed to be Loki in the Disney+ series Loki, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.An annual CooperCon convention is held in Seattle, letting Cooper enthusiasts and researchers swap theories.None of it has led to any answers.Max Shaffer, then chief of security for the Seattle region of the Federal Aviation Administration, told the New York Times in 1972 he believed Cooper was dead. I feel that one of these days some hunter in Oregon or Washington is going to find the skeleton of this man, he said.As of July 12, 2016, the FBI had officially ended their investigation, leaving it as one of the longest cold cases in the agency’s history. The mystery surrounding the hijacking of a Northwest Orient Airlines flight in 1971 by a still-unknown individual resulted in significant international attention and a decades-long manhunt, they said in a statement. Evidence obtained during the course of the investigation will now be preserved for historical purposes at FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC.

(Facebook)Their intelligence on Mr Ayik came after he was unwittingly recruited into spreading a police-bugged app, called AN0M, into the underworld by the AFP.The joint AFP and FBI operation involved planting the devices into the hands of criminals and watching on as they used it to organise murders, drug shipments and beatings in Australia and abroad.No AN0M cases against anyone charged in Australia have ever revealed what, if any, link they had to Mr Ayik, deepening the mystery of who one senior law enforcement source described as a Mr Big of the underworld .But a trove of court documents from the United States, released in recent months, reveal his alleged role in luring his mates into the police trap.The man behind the 'Oscar' monikerAs part of their investigation the AFP revealed how rival bikies and crime families would work together using AN0M to supply drugs all over Australia.In court documents from related AN0M cases in the United States, prosecutors described Mr Ayik as an influencer — a role that proved a profitable side hustle.In one filing referring to Mr Ayik under his AN0M username Oscar , one of his associates described how all the profits from the sale of 100 devices would go straight to him.Alleged Australian drug lord Hakan Ayik poses in a Facebook profile photo. (Facebook)That transaction would earn him $75,000 in Bitcoin, according to court documents.The same underling, the documents said, would go on to discuss in messages on the device how Mr Ayik and the crew could start a VIP service for certain AN0M customers.Others paint the picture of Mr Ayik as being the go-to person for AN0M, who would go on to sell more than 12,000 devices as well as allegedly leading the Comanchero from overseas.The Comanchero are one of the most powerful bikie gangs in Australia, who suffered a power struggle during Sydney's recent gangland war.What the AN0M device looked like, before it was revealed to be a police Trojan horse app. (Supplied: AFP)In another court document from the United States, an underling asks Mr Ayik: Touching base with you in relation to AN0M device we prepared for client Tiger? Another describes how Mr Ayik is alleged to have sent clients to those under him and how those clients paid cash through a family member of Mr Ayik.When news of the AN0M operation first broke, rumours from underworld and police sources purported Mr Ayik had fled for his safety to either Syria or Iraq.Two years later in 2023, 46-year-old Mr Ayik would be apprehended shirtless by Turkish police in a posh apartment belonging to him in the heart of Istanbul.Hakan Ayik, during his now infamous capture in Istanbul in 2023. (Reuters: Turkish Interior Ministry/Handout )Charges with a 262-year jail termMr Ayik lived a life of luxury while on the run in Türkiye, though the alleged drug kingpin will likely never face justice down under.Among the lavish hotels, cars and businesses in Istanbul, Mr Ayik was far from going to ground while wanted for a raft of serious drug offences across the globe.Vast swathes of his wealth have now been seized by Turkish authorities who are prosecuting him for a series of alleged drug crimes and money laundering offences.If convicted he faces 262 years in prison.Mr Ayik was rumoured to be a billion-dollar bikie while posting flashy social media snaps on the run and estimates of his wealth ranged from $250 million to as high as $1 billion.The former Sydney bikie is also wanted on a racketeering indictment in the US and appears on watch lists for police authorities from Europe to Australia.Hotels fit for a kingThe Kings Cross Hotel in Istanbul, owned by alleged Sydney crime boss Hakan Ayik.

(Supplied: Facebook )Another alleged proceed of what police claim is his global drug empire is a stake in a five-star resort in the Turkish beachside town of Alacati founded by him and a partner, corporate records state.The resort has never been revealed to be among Mr Ayik's business ventures before, and to this day it is still offering enviable beach views and a luxury stay for sun hungry tourists.It is unclear if it is among the seizures by Turkish authorities after Mr Ayik's arrest, though rooms at the highest rate currently go for more than $5,000 a night.Posted Fri 11 Jul 2025 at 10:16pmFriday 11 Jul 2025 at 10:16pmFri 11 Jul 2025 at 10:16pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top Stories'Raise taxes to fix budget': Treasury advises Labor in accidentally published adviceTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows Jim Chalmers reads the budget book in his office.Treasury documents uncovered through diligent attempts to get them deletedAnalysis by Daniel ZifferPhoto shows The front exterior of the Treasury building in Canberra.Albo's visit to China before meeting Trump makes sense: Xi is now more importantAAnalysis by Alan KohlerPhoto shows Donald Trump frowns as he looks off camera while Xi Jinping stands behind him.The 'uncharismatic, illiterate' criminal behind Gaza's aid-looting gangsTopic:CrimePhoto shows Yasser Abu Shabab wears a combat vest and holds a rifle as he sits and poses for a picture.PM to laud explosive growth in trade with ChinaTopic:Foreign AffairsPhoto shows Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wears yellow tie and navy jacket, blue steel behind himRelated storiesThe Australian fugitive who led his criminal friends into a police trapTopic:CrimePhoto shows A shirtless Hakan Ayik flexes his muscles while working out at the gym.Tech whiz deported back to Sydney over AN0M bugged phone stingTopic:PolicePhoto shows A man posing in front of a green bushRelated topicsCourtsCrimePoliceSydneyTurkiyeTop Stories'Raise taxes to fix budget': Treasury advises Labor in accidentally published adviceTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows Jim Chalmers reads the budget book in his office.Treasury documents uncovered through diligent attempts to get them deletedAnalysis by Daniel ZifferAlbo's visit to China before meeting Trump makes sense: Xi is now more importantAAnalysis by Alan KohlerThe 'uncharismatic, illiterate' criminal behind Gaza's aid-looting gangsTopic:CrimePM to laud explosive growth in trade with ChinaTopic:Foreign AffairsJust InRussian agents killed after Ukrainian officer shot dead in Kyiv, SBU saysTopic:Unrest, Conflict and War26m ago26 minutes agoMon 14 Jul 2025 at 1:36amPlane crashes in 'big fireball' after take-off, forcing closure of London airportTopic:Air Incidents32m ago32 minutes agoMon 14 Jul 2025 at 1:30amGisèle Pelicot receives France's top civic honourTopic:Sexual Offences33m ago33 minutes agoMon 14 Jul 2025 at 1:28amDriving 10 hours for groceries a thing of the past as town welcomes new storeTopic:Feel Good1h ago1 hours agoMon 14 Jul 2025 at 12:28amMore Just InBack to top 'Raise taxes to fix budget': Treasury advises Labor in accidentally published adviceTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows Jim Chalmers reads the budget book in his office.

(Supplied: Supreme Court of Western Australia)Instead, the pellets hit and killed Ralph Matthews Cox, who did not know Nguyen-Ha and had no involvement in the drug world.The jury deliberated for two days before finding Nguyen-Ha guilty of one charge of murder, as well as five counts of doing an act likely to endanger life.Final act in series of shootingsDuring his trial, Nguyen-Ha admitted firing the gun twice but claimed he replaced the shotgun shells with pellets filled with rock salt.He told the court it was his alleged accomplice, Matthew Gempton, who fired a third, fatal shot with a different gun.Gempton, a self-described debt collector, already received a reduced sentence for manslaughter over his role in the shooting after agreeing to be a key witness in Nguyen-Ha's trial.He admitted being Nguyen-Ha's driver in the shooting but said it was his accomplice who fired the gun.Police found Ralph Matthews Cox critically injured at a house in Landsdale in January 2022. (ABC News)The intended target of the shooting, Anthony Prior, admitted in court he had bashed Nguyen-Ha and stolen tens of thousands of dollars from him in late 2021, in a set-up which involved fake drugs.That triggered two earlier shootings at homes in Perth's northern suburbs in which Nguyen-Ha, along with Gempton, were targeting Prior.The prosecution maintained that in those shootings Nguyen-Ha was not a mere bystander but was a planner, and that he was indeed the lone gunman in the final Landsdale shooting.On that night, Mr Cox and his partner were asleep in their front bedroom and stirred when they heard someone outside.He said I've been hit , when he was shot, the court heard.Nguyen-Ha will face a sentencing hearing on August 22.

(ABC News: Che Chorley)In short:A teenager has been sentenced for his role in the ambush attacks on three men who were enticed to meetings via social media under the guise of sexual encounters.The 17-year-old did not orchestrate the meetings, but participated and did not attempt to stop it.What's next? The teenager was spared convictions but ordered to participate in family conferencing and placed on a six-month good behaviour bond.abc.net.au/news/teen-sentenced-for-vigilante-ambush-attacks/105511878Link copiedShareShare articleA teenager involved in vigilante attacks on men lured to meet-ups via social media under the guise of sexual encounters, has been spared convictions for his crimes.The now 18-year-old, was sentenced in Adelaide's Youth Court this week for his involvement in two separate ambushes instigated by his lifelong friend .In sentencing, Magistrate Tracee Micallef said the teen's friend had pretended to be an underage girl on social media and had sexualised conversations with a man aged in his 30s, before luring him to meet in person. The victim thought he was meeting to engage in a sexual interaction with what he thought was a young girl, she said.Ms Micallef said the teenager, who was 17 at the time, only became involved in the offending when his friend invited him to the planned meeting with the man in February. The [friend] came to you and said he had organised to meet up with a paedophile, Ms Micallef said. You agreed to go with him without making any further inquiries as to what was planned or what was happening … you clearly knew that a confrontation was likely to occur. 'Humiliating and degrading' act filmedDuring the confrontation, which involved a group of youths, the man was threatened with a machete and blocked from leaving.Ms Micallef said the man was forced to transfer money to one of the other youths' accounts, and told to remove his shirt and kiss the shoes of the group or he would be assaulted.The man initially refused and was punched. As he was in fear, he did what was asked of him and it was filmed — that is the humiliating and degrading act, Ms Micallef said.She said the victim fled and later tried to have the money returned via his bank but stopped the investigation when he received threats that the footage and embarrassing messages would be released to his family and workplace.Ms Micallef said the victim would always have a concern that the video footage of him is still out there in the cloud somewhere .She said the teen had agreed he was equally responsible for the offending despite not being the instigator or the planner .The teenager had pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated robbery, blackmail and engaging in humiliating or degrading filming in relation to that incident, along with aggravated robbery and attempted aggravated robbery in relation to a second incident in April this year.The men were lured to meet with the youths via social media. (AP: Jenny Kane)Ms Micallef said the second incident involved ambushing two men who were lured to a public area, for what they thought would be a sexual experiment, or interaction, with a third male .She said the two men saw someone in the dark , and were asked, but refused, to go back to their house or a school before they were threatened with a machete.A group of youths, including the now-18-year-old, assaulted the men — one of whom was put in a headlock — and tried to take their keys and wallets, but the men escaped and alerted the police.Ms Micallef said the teen was again not involved in the set-up, nor wielding the machete or making threats but was willingly present.She said the teen — who had spent about two weeks in youth detention after his arrest — had a stable home life, was well-behaved at school and had provided multiple glowing character references to the court.The magistrate said the teen had recognised that despite being long-time friends, the youth who organised the meetings was now a negative influence on your behaviour .'Vigilante behaviour is not acceptable'She said the court had been told that aside from his close friend, he did not know the other youths involved and had been dragged into the offending. Whilst I can accept that the first time you joined your childhood friend you may have not been aware of the planned robbery or humiliation or blackmail … but you did participate in it, she said. You did not leave, nor did you try to stop it. Even if you did nothing but stand there, by your presence you made it frightening for the victim and supported the others in that action. I can also accept that to some extent you may have thought that you were dealing with, or somehow punishing someone who was behaving inappropriately, or about to. However, this behaviour cannot be condoned in any way … this type of vigilante behaviour is not acceptable. Ms Micallef diverted the youth to family conferencing for the offences against the first victim and imposed a six-month good behaviour bond for the second incident. She did not impose any convictions.Posted Thu 10 Jul 2025 at 8:05pmThursday 10 Jul 2025 at 8:05pmThu 10 Jul 2025 at 8:05pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top Stories'Raise taxes to fix budget': Treasury advises Labor in accidentally published adviceTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows Jim Chalmers reads the budget book in his office.Treasury documents uncovered through diligent attempts to get them deletedAnalysis by Daniel ZifferPhoto shows The front exterior of the Treasury building in Canberra.Albo's visit to China before meeting Trump makes sense: Xi is now more importantAAnalysis by Alan KohlerPhoto shows Donald Trump frowns as he looks off camera while Xi Jinping stands behind him.The 'uncharismatic, illiterate' criminal behind Gaza's aid-looting gangsTopic:CrimePhoto shows Yasser Abu Shabab wears a combat vest and holds a rifle as he sits and poses for a picture.PM to laud explosive growth in trade with ChinaTopic:Foreign AffairsPhoto shows Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wears yellow tie and navy jacket, blue steel behind himPopular nowPlane crashes in 'big fireball' after take-off, forcing closure of London airportTopic:Air IncidentsPhoto shows plane crash londonPensioner robbed of $1,338 is taking NAB to court for millionsTopic:BankingPhoto shows Ian wears a black coat and red scarf with hands in his pockets looking into the camera outside the a stone courthousePolice seek witnesses after baby drowns at highway rest stopTopic:DrowningsPhoto shows Queensland police vehicleRelated topicsAdelaideCourtsCrimeLaw, Crime and JusticeSASentencingTop Stories'Raise taxes to fix budget': Treasury advises Labor in accidentally published adviceTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows Jim Chalmers reads the budget book in his office.Treasury documents uncovered through diligent attempts to get them deletedAnalysis by Daniel ZifferAlbo's visit to China before meeting Trump makes sense: Xi is now more importantAAnalysis by Alan KohlerThe 'uncharismatic, illiterate' criminal behind Gaza's aid-looting gangsTopic:CrimePM to laud explosive growth in trade with ChinaTopic:Foreign AffairsJust InRussian agents killed after Ukrainian officer shot dead in Kyiv, SBU saysTopic:Unrest, Conflict and War26m ago26 minutes agoMon 14 Jul 2025 at 1:36amPlane crashes in 'big fireball' after take-off, forcing closure of London airportTopic:Air Incidents32m ago32 minutes agoMon 14 Jul 2025 at 1:30amGisèle Pelicot receives France's top civic honourTopic:Sexual Offences34m ago34 minutes agoMon 14 Jul 2025 at 1:28amDriving 10 hours for groceries a thing of the past as town welcomes new storeTopic:Feel Good1h ago1 hours agoMon 14 Jul 2025 at 12:28amMore Just InBack to top 'Raise taxes to fix budget': Treasury advises Labor in accidentally published adviceTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows Jim Chalmers reads the budget book in his office.

The remains of Charlie Gander's body were found in a burnt-out car at Bunbartha on Christmas Eve, 2022.Kylie Stott, Dimitri D'Elio and Danny Clarke have pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, murder and arson in a trial painted by the prosecution as a desire for revenge against Charlie for ratting out their associate to the police.The jury was shown photos taken by Victoria Police of the burnt car, which contained the remains of Charlie Gander's body. (Supplied: Supreme Court of Victoria)At the time of the alleged offending, Ms Stott was aged 37, Mr D'Elio 24 and Mr Clarke 38.All three have pleaded not guilty.The 12 jurors have begun deliberating after 30 days of hearings, including about 41 witnesses made up of pathologists, DNA experts, emergency services and police officers. The jury also heard statements read out by the prosecutor from Mr Gander's girlfriend and his father Richard Gander, including final texts between the pair. Police evidence cost teenager 'dearly', says CrownIn his final address, Mr Gibson argued that each of the accused was guilty of the three charges because each of them was part of an agreement, arrangement or understanding with the others to kidnap Charlie Gander, to murder Charlie Gander and to burn the Ford Territory with Charlie Gander's body in it .Mr Gibson told the jury the alleged motive was Mr Gander's cooperation with police investigating a firearms breach by Tyson May, who was a good friend of Ms Stott. Mr Gander was also friends with Mr May and would hang out with him, the court heard.Following a police raid in Shepparton in November 2022, Mr Gander gave a police interview and made a witness statement about Mr May possessing a firearm. The court heard Gander's body contained high levels of ice, which could not be ruled out as a cause of death. (Supplied: Gander family)Mr May was under a firearms prohibition order, Mr Gibson said. A disc with the record of Mr Gander's police interview found its way into the hands of others , Mr Gibson said. It cost him dearly, he said.The court heard a kitchen knife wrapped in a bloodstained tea towel from under a car seat had a mixed DNA profile of four people, including Mr Gander. Forensic pathologist Paul Bedford, who conducted Mr Gander's autopsy, previously told the court extensive fire damage to the body meant the cause of death could not be ascertained.He also told the court toxicology reports had found very high levels of the drug methylamphetamine, commonly known as ice, which may have contributed to Mr Gander's death.Defence arguments Justice Michael Croucher presented a summary of the defence counsel's arguments to the court before the jury began deliberating.Daniel Sala, acting for Ms Stott, has rejected the prosecution's arguments that she was key in orchestrating the acts against Mr Gander and urged the jury to find her not guilty of murder or arson. Paul Kounnas, acting on behalf of Mr D'Elio, has argued Ms Stott and Mr Clarke were the prime movers in the alleged crimes and that Mr D'Elio was dragged along and used as a patsy . Emergency services found the car on fire on a dirt road in Bunbartha in Victoria's north. (Supplied: Supreme Court of Victoria)The court heard Mr D'Elio, who was in a relationship with Ms Stott, did not know Mr Gander or Mr Clarke and had no skin in the game .Christopher Terry, acting on behalf of Mr Clarke, has argued his client did not intend to kill Mr Gander or enter into any agreement to do so. He said there was no evidence of Mr Clarke's hatred towards Mr Gander or proof of an agreement, and that his client had been dragged into a terrible crime .Charges heard togetherJustice Croucher instructed the jury that they must reach a unanimous verdict for each of the accused, who each face three charges. The jury heard they may find the accused guilty of manslaughter as an alternative if they are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the higher charge of murder. Justice Croucher told the jury manslaughter did not require an intent to kill, but there must be an intentional assault that was dangerous and posed serious injury. He also told the jury their task did not include making moral judgements.He noted jurors had been tasked with not one trial but 12 separate decisions, with the three accused facing three charges and the potential for manslaughter. The 12 charges are being heard together for convenience, and the jury must not allow this fact to usurp justice and must consider each charge separately, Justice Croucher said.Posted Thu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:39amThursday 10 Jul 2025 at 9:39amThu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:39am, updated Thu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:41amThursday 10 Jul 2025 at 9:41amThu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:41amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top Stories'Raise taxes to fix budget': Treasury advises Labor in accidentally published adviceTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows Jim Chalmers reads the budget book in his office.Treasury documents uncovered through diligent attempts to get them deletedAnalysis by Daniel ZifferPhoto shows The front exterior of the Treasury building in Canberra.Albo's visit to China before meeting Trump makes sense: Xi is now more importantAAnalysis by Alan KohlerPhoto shows Donald Trump frowns as he looks off camera while Xi Jinping stands behind him.The 'uncharismatic, illiterate' criminal behind Gaza's aid-looting gangsTopic:CrimePhoto shows Yasser Abu Shabab wears a combat vest and holds a rifle as he sits and poses for a picture.PM to laud explosive growth in trade with ChinaTopic:Foreign AffairsPhoto shows Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wears yellow tie and navy jacket, blue steel behind himPopular nowPlane crashes in 'big fireball' after take-off, forcing closure of London airportTopic:Air IncidentsPhoto shows plane crash londonPensioner robbed of $1,338 is taking NAB to court for millionsTopic:BankingPhoto shows Ian wears a black coat and red scarf with hands in his pockets looking into the camera outside the a stone courthousePolice seek witnesses after baby drowns at highway rest stopTopic:DrowningsPhoto shows Queensland police vehicleRelated topicsBunbarthaCourtsCrimeMelbourneSheppartonTop Stories'Raise taxes to fix budget': Treasury advises Labor in accidentally published adviceTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows Jim Chalmers reads the budget book in his office.Treasury documents uncovered through diligent attempts to get them deletedAnalysis by Daniel ZifferAlbo's visit to China before meeting Trump makes sense: Xi is now more importantAAnalysis by Alan KohlerThe 'uncharismatic, illiterate' criminal behind Gaza's aid-looting gangsTopic:CrimePM to laud explosive growth in trade with ChinaTopic:Foreign AffairsJust InRussian agents killed after Ukrainian officer shot dead in Kyiv, SBU saysTopic:Unrest, Conflict and War26m ago26 minutes agoMon 14 Jul 2025 at 1:36amPlane crashes in 'big fireball' after take-off, forcing closure of London airportTopic:Air Incidents32m ago32 minutes agoMon 14 Jul 2025 at 1:30amGisèle Pelicot receives France's top civic honourTopic:Sexual Offences34m ago34 minutes agoMon 14 Jul 2025 at 1:28amDriving 10 hours for groceries a thing of the past as town welcomes new storeTopic:Feel Good1h ago1 hours agoMon 14 Jul 2025 at 12:28amMore Just InBack to top 'Raise taxes to fix budget': Treasury advises Labor in accidentally published adviceTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows Jim Chalmers reads the budget book in his office.

Ms McGuire was reported missing by her family in April last year, and her body was later found in a burnt-out vehicle south-west of Ballarat. Hannah McGuire, 23, was found dead inside a burnt-out vehicle in April last year. (Supplied: GoFundMe)In opening remarks, chief prosecutor Kristie Churchill told the court Ms McGuire's three-year relationship with Mr Young was controlling and turbulent , and included a series of intervention orders.In one instance, Ms Churchill said Mr Young called Ms McGuire 129 times in a single day.The prosecution will argue that Mr Young murdered Ms McGuire at the Sebastopol home they once shared, before putting her body in the footwell of a car, driving her out to a remote location, and setting both on fire. Ms Churchill told the court that autopsy reports concluded Ms McGuire was dead before the fire started. The prosecution said it would argue Mr Young staged Ms McGuire's death to look like a suicide and systematically deleted evidence.The prosecution rejected Lachlan Young's guilty plea to manslaughter. (Instagram)It is alleged Mr Young seized Ms McGuire's phone post murder and sent text messages as Ms McGuire to her mother and himself. I'm sorry mum, I thought this was the right decision. I tried to heal and cope with it all but I'm not ok, read the beginning of one text Mr Young sent from Ms McGuire's phone to her mother.The prosecution will also argue Mr Young transferred thousands of dollars to Ms McGuire's mother and himself and continued to spread a bunch of lies to friends, family, and police in the days after her murder.Floral tributes were left for Hannah McGuire at the site where her remains were found. (AAP: Con Chronis )Charge of murderMr Young's defence, led by Glenn Casement, told the court the 22-year old man made a very serious admission pleading guilty to manslaughter.Mr Casement said although Mr Young made a series of appalling, bad choices in an attempt to obscure what he did, he did not kill Ms McGuire with murderous intent .The Supreme Court will sit in Ballarat for the next five weeks. (ABC News: Julia Bergin)The defence will argue Mr Young's actions were foolish and shameful , but Ms McGuire's death was an unplanned and spontaneous event .Throughout the next five weeks, the court will hear from a number of witnesses, including friends, family, medical experts, and the man who assisted Mr Young to dispose of the car containing Ms McGuire's body. What's next?A jury of 14 was empanelled on Wednesday morning and will be required to make a unanimous decision, beyond reasonable doubt, on whether Mr Young murdered Ms McGuire.There are four key elements they need to satisfy: that Mr Young caused the death of Ms McGuire, that he did so consciously, voluntarily and deliberately, that he intended to kill or cause serious injury, and that there was no lawful justification or excuse for his actions.

Assistant Commissioner Wood said those targeted were some of the most vulnerable in the community, who allegedly lost $3 million. They, I would describe, are very, very vulnerable people, he said. The majority are female and elderly. They underpin the word vulnerability. And that's what makes this scam, this crime, let's not call it a scam, this crime, so serious. They are like piranhas; they are circling around vulnerable people and they are robbing them, at times, of huge amounts of money.

There's no rules with these people; they're predators. When they see an opportunity, when they need to work as a group they will work as a group, he said. It is extremely sad to see how they act, targeting individuals who are vulnerable, who are elderly. They have no chance.

Dale Zanine Dale Zanine-USA TODAY Sports Quinshon Judkins, a rookie running back for the Cleveland Browns, punched his ex-girlfriend in the mouth during a heated argument over text messages while the couple vacationed in South Florida, police say.Judkins’ ex reported the domestic violence incident on Saturday — although the battery occurred five days before, on July 6. Judkins, 21, was arrested at the Four Seasons Hotel, 525 N Fort Lauderdale Beach Blvd, per a police report.The victim told investigators she waited to report the incident because “she felt bad due to [Judkins’] recent success and career” but changed her mind after speaking with her loved ones. Judkins and his ex-girlfriend had split in December but were rekindling their relationship at the time of the incident, the report shows.READ MORE: Cleveland Browns rookie cuffed after domestic violence incident in Broward: copsJudkins, who faces a misdemeanor domestic battery charge, bonded out of the Broward Main Jail on Sunday. The Miami Herald reached out to his attorney David Weinstein but hasn’t received a response as of Monday afternoon.Judkins’ ex-girlfriend told investigators that their spat began at the baggage claim of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, when Judkins got frustrated after reading messages from family members. The nature of the messages wasn’t mention in the police report.However, their argument escalated when they entered a Lamborghini SUV. Judkins’ ex, according to the report, told him the messages weren’t true, then Judkins punched her in the mouth.Officers noted in the report that she had visible bruising on her chin — and photographs of her injuries.At one point, the victim got out of the SUV and called Judkins’ mother, although she didn’t tell her what had transpired, the report says. She got back inside, and the squabble over the messages continued. Judkins then hit his ex-girlfriend several times while driving, according to the report. She had visible bruises on her arm and thigh — and photos of her injuries, officers noted.She told police she began to kick her feet at Judkins to defend herself, the report says. Shortly after, Judkins pulled into a Burger King parking lot, where his ex told him, “Don’t touch me again.”It’s unclear from the police report what happened in the five days before she reported the incident.Judkins was selected in the second round with the 36th overall pick in the 2025 NFL draft by the Browns after having played for the Ohio State Buckeyes. In 2022, he was named SEC Freshman of the Year when he was a second-string running back for the University of Mississippi Rebels.

Miami Police are not saying what they’re doing to bring him back. Jason Getz Jason Getz-USA TODAY Sports A month after being charged with attempted murder, former NFL star Antonio Brown has posted videos on social media flaunting his lavish lifestyle abroad — riding around in expensive cars and sauntering on a yacht overlooking Dubai’s skyscrapers.It’s almost as if Brown, 37, were taunting police. But Miami Police will not say whether they consider Brown on the run — or if they’re working to bring him back to the U.S. to face trial.A Miami-Dade judge signed off on Brown’s arrest warrant a month ago. But police don’t appear to be looking for him and refuse to discuss the case. There’s also no record or court date for Brown in the database of Miami-Dade circuit court records.READ MORE: Antonio Brown charged with attempted murder after shooting at Miami boxing eventIn a video uploaded to X on Thursday, Brown is seen celebrating his birthday in a red Ferrari 812 GTS and hanging out with his young sons on the water.

After the shooting, Brown said on social media that he was attacked by people trying to steal his jewelry.

The jewelry designer spent a month in jail in the United Arab Emirates, documents show, before proving that Brown lied.READ MORE: Antonio Brown’s false accusations put Miami jeweler in Dubai jail for month: lawsuitPeople accused of crimes usually negotiate with authorities to surrender upon their return. Brown had an attorney early on who secured him a $10,000 bond, including house arrest. As of Thursday, it’s unclear if Brown was being represented by an attorney. Another unknown: whether prosecutors will continue to honor the bond agreement in place. Brown could be detained by the FBI or U.S. Marshals if Miami Police or the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office request that the federal agencies issue a warrant for Brown’s return, said Jeffrey Sloman, a Miami criminal defense attorney who served briefly as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. This is usually accomplished through a federal charge brought forward if a person is avoiding prosecution. If a person remains a fugitive, they may not be granted bond to get out of jail, or a judge could be more harsh in their confinement, Sloman said. The attorney said to look no further than his client Ohad Fisherman, who was on his honeymoon in Japan but returned quickly to address the criminal charge against him. Fisherman — who was entangled in one of the cases brought by the state against the Alexander brothers — had a sex crime charge against him dropped on Monday by state prosecutors.READ MORE: Alexander brothers’ friend cleared in sex case — tearful, angry at state prosecutors“It’s in [Brown’s] best interest to come back immediately, so hopefully the judge would give him a reasonable bond so he can fight the charges out of jail,” Sloman said. “It’s very difficult to fight a case in jail. If Mr. Brown continues to avoid prosecution, eventually he will travel somewhere or to some place and he will be arrested.”Padilla told the Herald police likely believe that Brown will return to South Florida because he has property and children in the area. Formally extraditing Brown, he said, would be costly.

Daniel A. Varela dvarela@miamiherald.com “It’s not easy for the FBI to be dragging people from the Middle East,” Padilla said. “There’ll be a point that if this continues, it could manifest into something larger.”Brown should contact an attorney to turn himself in, Padilla said, because a judge could factor in the amount of time he was abroad after the warrant was signed when deciding his bond. “This is a serious crime. This isn’t going to go away,” Padilla said. “...He’s going to have to face these charges.” Grethel Aguila Miami Herald Go to X Email this person Grethel covers courts and the criminal justice system for the Miami Herald.

He was the father of two children. The driver was arrested Tuesday, July 8, 2025. GoFundMe Andres Roberto Fiallos Estupiñan, accused of running down and killing a father who was jogging in his Shenandoah neighborhood, was booked into jail Tuesday after he was released from Jackson Memorial Hospital, where police had to Taser him to subdue him, his attorney said.Fiallos Estupiñan had been hospitalized since June 10 after suffering a broken ankle while fleeing the scene of the fatal hit-and-run at Southwest 21st Avenue and 18th Street. Residents tackled him near Shenandoah Park after they say he struck 50-year-old jogger Andrew Loretta with a Volkswagen Jetta, then careened into an ice cream truck and several other vehicles before attempting to run away.Jail records show that Fiallos Estupiñan, 36, was hit with multiple charges, including leaving the scene of the crash involving death, leaving the scene of a crash with serious bodily injury, reckless driving and vehicular homicide. READ MORE: Suspect in Miami hit-and-run unconscious for weeks after hospital clash with copsPsychotic episode caused the tragedy, attorney saysFiallos Estupiñan was hospitalized for weeks and listed in critical condition, leaving his family and attorney reeling with questions on how his condition deteriorated when he went in for a broken ankle. His attorney, Bradley Horenstein, said Fiallos Estupiñan — who has a history of mental health issues — had a psychotic episode that started before the crash.“This unimaginably tragic case is the result of Mr. Fiallos Estupiñan having suffered a psychotic break, which the hospital spent weeks successfully treating with medication,” Horenstein told the Miami Herald Wednesday.According to Horenstein, Fiallos Estupiñan became agitated while handcuffed to a hospital bed and attempted to get up and leave. A Miami police officer stationed at his bedside Tasered Fiallos Estupiñan multiple times to subdue him. When that had little effect, hospital staff gave him ketamine, an anesthetic used for surgery, and Estupinan was intubated for his safety. A psychiatric evaluation conducted at the hospital provided further detail on the severity of Fiallos Estupiñan’s condition. According to the five-page report, he ripped out his IV line, jumped out of bed naked while handcuffed and set off a hospital alarm after throwing himself against a wall vent.Horenstein said doctors continued to sedate him as he was not responding to medications for the psychosis. Further, Fiallos Estupiñan developed pneumonia and a bacterial infection in his lungs, which landed him in critical condition and the Intensive Care Unit. Andres Roberto Fiallo Estupinan, accused of the hit-and-run death of a Shenandoah father out for a jog on June 10, was jailed Tuesday, July 8, 2025. He’s facing a slew of charges. Estupinan family photo For three weeks, Horenstein was unable to speak to his client due to the heavy sedation.At one point, doctors performed a tracheotomy to avoid long-term damage to his vocal cords from prolonged intubation. Horenstein noted the situation was so dire that his client’s mother was granted a humanitarian visa to fly to the U.S. and sit by his bedside.“The hospital and the City of Miami Police Department were very accommodating,” Horenstein said.Fiallos Estupiñan was slowly weaned off the sedatives as the anti-psychotic medication began to take effect; he is now lucid and calm, Horenstein said.Set to be released on conditionsFiallos Estupiñan appeared in Miami-Dade Bond Court on Wednesday before Judge Gisela Cardonne Ely in an orange jumpsuit with a visible cast on his leg. At the hearing, prosecutors said Fiallos Estupiñan was driving 75 miles per hour in a 25-mph residential zone at the time of the crash. They argued he is both a danger to the community and a flight risk.Prosecutors requested Fiallos Estupiñan’s total bond be set at no less than $100,000 and that if released, he be placed on house arrest, be barred from driving and have his passport confiscated.Horenstein pushed back, telling the judge his client is not a danger to himself or others, but made no arguments on the $100,000 bond. He noted that Fiallos Estupiñan had been hospitalized for nearly a month after the crash and is a commercial engineer by profession. His mother and sister were present in the courtroom.The judge set bond at $25,000 for each charge, for a total of $100,000. She also ordered Fiallos Estupiñan to be placed on Level 2 house arrest, meaning he can only leave home for work, church or meetings with his lawyer.Fiallos Estupiñan, who was born in Ecuador and lived in Chile, was also ordered to surrender his passport before being released from jail. Horenstein said the passport was believed to be inside Estupinan’s car, which has been impounded as evidence by the Miami Police Department.Despite that, Judge Cardonne Ely said the passport must be turned over before Estupinan could walk out of jail. Prosecutors asked Horenstein to provide proof the passport was not in his client’s possession. The judge removed the passport confiscation condition after Horenstein said he confirmed with the Miami Police sergeant supervising the case that the passport was in their possession.Witnesses held him downAccording to his arrest affidavit, Fiallos Estupiñan was driving a gray 2012 Volkswagen Passat on June 10 at a “high rate of speed” southbound on Southwest 21st Avenue near 17th Street just before 7 p.m. Police say he had an expired Florida driver’s license.At the same time, Andrew Loretta, 50, was jogging along the west side of 21st Avenue, heading toward 18th Street.Surveillance footage shows Fiallos Estupiñan striking the jogger from behind with such force that Loretta was thrown into the air and both of his legs were severed.After hitting Loretta, Fiallos Estupiñan crashed into a white 2013 Nissan ice cream van that was stopped at 21st Avenue and 18th Street, serving children at Shenandoah Park. Police say Estupinan made no “visible attempt to brake” before the impact.The Volkswagen then struck two more parked vehicles: a gray 2019 Toyota and a white 2023 Mercedes SUV, both on the west side of 21st Avenue near the park.Two witnesses told police that Fiallos Estupiñan immediately got out of the car and ran away without trying to help the injured jogger or calling 911. He ran into Shenandoah Park, where several bystanders stopped him and held him down until officers arrived.Loretta was pronounced dead at the scene. Estupinan had a broken ankle, while a passenger in one of the hit cars had a skull fracture.A beloved community memberIn Miami’s Shenandoah neighborhood, just off Coral Way, the sudden death of Loretta—a married telecommunications executive and father of two teenagers—has left his family heartbroken and the community in shock. Friends and relatives described him as an avid jogger and soccer enthusiast who moved to Miami from California in 2000. He was fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.A GoFundMe page to support Andrew’s family has raised over $193,000 with just over 900 donations.“I hope that justice is served. Not only for Andy, but for the family ... At the end of the day [Andres] has to deal with his own karma. I honestly feel a lot of compassion for him. It’s just a terrible situation,” John Loretta, Andrew’s cousin, who lives in Kendall, said.The Loretta family, including his wife and children, said in a statement through their attorney that they are grateful for the support they have received.“This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the Loretta family, and they remain deeply grateful for the outpouring of support from family, friends, and the community,” Raul Chacon, the family’s attorney, said in a statement to the Miami Herald. “At this point, they will have no further comment on the ongoing legal proceedings. Thank you for respecting their privacy and understanding their need to grieve in peace. “Miami Herald writer Isabel Rivera contributed to this report.This story was originally published July 9, 2025 at 4:17 PM.

Suarez pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit bank and mail fraud, along with aggravated identity theft. He faces several years in prison, including mandatory-minimum punishment of two years for the ID theft conviction, at his sentencing hearing in September before U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams.Suarez was indicted in 2023 but was living in Panama City, Panama, at the time. In early 2025, he was arrested in Panama and brought to South Florida to face the charges. According to a factual statement filed with his plea agreement, here’s how Suarez carried out the scam during an FBI-led undercover operation:More than 80 fraudulent checksIn March 2022, Suarez told a confidential informant that he had access to the bank account of an elderly person, who was 82 years old at the time. Suarez created and mailed dozens of falsified checks from Panama to South Florida to the victim’s bank with directions to cash them and return half of the money to his account at Bank of America. The ill-gotten proceeds were wired to his Miami-based company, Online Electronics.To carry out the scheme, Suarez’s fraudulent checks contained forged signatures designed to resemble that of the victim’s on a signature card at Truist Bank.“In total, Suarez and his co-conspirators stole $803,146 from [the victim’s] bank account at Truist through the issuance of more than 80 fraudulent checks to numerous different payees, including at least five individuals and various companies,” according to the factual statement signed by the defendant, his lawyer and a prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami.The statement also said the elderly person reviewed the names of the individuals and companies involved in the fraudulent check transactions. The person did not authorize any of them.The case, investigated by the FBI, Secret Service and FDIC’s Office of Inspector General, was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Thor Pogozelski.This story was originally published July 10, 2025 at 11:32 AM.

Once limited to Southeast Asia, the criminal model is spreading — and uses AI.https://p.dw.com/p/4whWKOnline scam centers were initially concentrated in Cambodia, with additional trafficking hubs later uncovered in Laos and MyanmarImage: Kyodo News/IMAGOAdvertisementHuman trafficking-fueled scam centers have significantly expanded their operations worldwide, according to a crime trend update released on Monday by the international police agency Interpol. Hubs where trafficking victims are forced to take part in online fraud first emerged in a few Southeast Asian nations, but investigators are now also uncovering similar fraud centers in other regions. Where are scam centers spreading? According to the international police organization, victims now come from 66 countries across all continents, highlighting what Interpol describes as a global crisis involving hundreds of thousands of people. Scam centers are now increasingly found in other regions, including the Middle East, West Africa — fast emerging as a new regional hub — and Central America. Victims are often lured with fake job offers and then held captive in scam compounds. Many are blackmailed over alleged debts, beaten, sexually exploited, and in some cases tortured or raped. Inside these centers, they are forced to run online scams, mostly targeting people abroad to steal money.Freed captives describe scam operations in MyanmarTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video A 2024 Interpol-led operation exposed dozens of cases where victims were coerced into committing fraud, including a raid on an industrial-scale scam centre in the Philippines. That same year, police dismantled a centre in Namibia where 88 youths were forced to scam others. Emerging technologies are fuelling this trend further. The crime update notes a surge in the use of artificial intelligence, from generating fake job ads to creating deepfake profiles for sextortion and romance scams. Who are the victims? Interpol says the pool of those preyed upon has widened significantly. While early human trafficking victims were mainly Chinese-speaking and came from China, Malaysia, Thailand or Singapore, people are now being trafficked to such hubs from South America, East Africa and Western Europe. Tackling this rapidly globalizing threat requires a coordinated international response, said said Interpol's acting head of police services Cyril Gout. Who are the people traffickers? The report found that about 90% of human trafficking facilitators came from Asia, while 11% were from South America or Africa. About 80% of these facilitators were men, with 61% aged between 20 and 39. Online scam centers were initially concentrated in Cambodia, with additional trafficking hubs later uncovered in Laos and Myanmar. Today, similar operations have been identified in at least four more Asian countries, and evidence shows the model is spreading to other regions such as West Africa, where cyber-enabled financial crime is already common. In its findings, Interpol warned that the spread of such criminal networks needs urgent, coordinated action to disrupt trafficking routes and support victims. Interpol said that these criminal hubs are increasingly intertwined with other major transnational crimes, demanding a globally coordinated response. Trafficking routes used for scam centers are being exploited for smuggling drugs, firearms, and endangered wildlife like tigers and pangolins, Interpol said.

Here's how the death cap became the center of a chilling murder case. https://p.dw.com/p/4x8P8Even small amounts of death cap mushrooms are lethal if consumed.Image: Hans Reinhard/Okapia/picture-allianceAdvertisementA jury in Australia has found Erin Patterson guilty on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder. The murder weapon: Toxic mushrooms. Prosecutors argued Patterson intentionally served four of her family members with meal portions containing toxic death cap mushrooms in 2023. Patterson denied being guilty, originally telling police she had used store-bought mushrooms from a supermarket, then an Asian grocer in Melbourne. A search of such stores found no evidence that poisonous mushrooms had ever been sold. During the trial, Patterson said she may have foraged for the mushrooms but could not say for certain where she had obtained the death caps. Why are death cap mushrooms so deadly? Deadly by name and by nature, death cap mushrooms (Amanita phalloides) are full of a highly stable toxin called alpha-Amanitin. The toxin is so stable that it won't break down when exposed to heat in cooking. When a death cap is eaten, people don’t usually feel symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea until at least 6 hours later. During this time the alpha-Amanitin toxins are making their way through the bloodstream into organs of the body. The toxin primarily acts in the liver, where it causes cells in the liver to die. Alpha-Amanitin binds with RNA polymerase-II enzymes, preventing the cells from creating new proteins. Eventually, the liver starts to shut down. Death can occur within 24 hours. Careful identification required The Amanita genus of fungi is well-known for their toxic properties. This group include the fairytale toadstool commonly known as the fly agaric, death caps, and destroying angels . But some other Amanita mushrooms are edible. Most cases of death cap poisoning are often a case of misidentification — their classic white appearance and domed cap looks like many other types of fungi. Identification of mushrooms requires a knowledge of different parts of the anatomy: the cap or fruiting body, the gills or spores beneath the cap, and the stipe — or stalk. While death caps look like many other mushrooms, one defining characteristic is their bad smell. They don't store well at all, unless you dehydrate them. They quickly go very stinky and very nasty, Brett Summerell, a fungi expert and Chief Scientist at the Botanic Gardens of Sydney, Australia, told DW. Because of the risk of misidentification by amateurs, it's usually recommended that foragers go for edible species that cannot be mistaken. Of course, foraging under the supervision of a trained mycologist — a fungi scientist — is usually a safe option. The famous red and white toadstool is a member of the Amanita genus, and a cousin of other deadly mushroom species.Image: FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP No death caps in the supermarket The jury ultimately didn’t find Patterson’s defense — that she mixed up foraged mushrooms in the same container as store-bought ones — believable. The prosecution argued Patterson knowingly put the toxic mushrooms in the home-cooked lunch and disposed of evidence. Summerell said the likelihood that death caps could get into store-bought products is, to be honest, farcical. The reason? Death caps only grow next to oak and beech trees. Death caps, like many fungi, are mycorrhizal, meaning they have a symbiotic relationship with the tree species. Death caps obtain their nutrients from nearby tree roots and return nutrients to the nearby soil. But because they can only grow at the base of oak and beech trees, it means there's no chance of them sprouting in a commercial setting, where spores are cultivated in highly controlled conditions — and with no trees in sight. Australia could get rid of death caps Death caps aren’t native to Australia, and neither are the oak and beech trees that support them. The trees were first introduced into Australia from Europe in the 19th ecntury, and death caps in the 1960s. Summerell and other mycologists are now discussing the possibility of removing oak trees in some parts of Australia. We have argued that, in Sydney, if it's at all possible, we should start to think about removing oak trees from some of these suburbs just from the point of view of a public health risk, said Summerell. Removing introduced oaks could harbor positive benefits, both from a public health perspective by removing the risk of the top cause of mushroom poisoning, as well as providing more space for native Australian plant life.

But some criminologists doubt the figures.https://p.dw.com/p/4wuVjShoplifting is on the rise, say retailersImage: Carsten Milbret/imageBROKER/picture allianceAdvertisementGermany has never had more shoplifters than in 2024. An annual survey of 98 retailers estimates a 3% increase on the year before — amounting to some €4.95 billion ($5.84 billion) in losses. The latest study by Germany's Retail Institute (EHI) on inventory differences shows that the vast majority of those losses (€4.2 billion) was down to theft from customers, employees, or delivery workers, the EHI said, which would mean losses of some €570 million to the public purse through lost sales tax. The EHI also said that retailers had to resort to balancing out their losses and the costs of extra security by increasing prices. Study author Frank Horst calculated that some 1.5% of prices in stores could now be attributed to covering theft and security. Shoplifting techniques The EHI said there had also been a 5% increase in organized shoplifting, which accounted for a third of the total shoplifting losses. Horst said this could be individual thieves working their way through a shopping list, or else, the thefts could be carried out by coordinated groups. One of them drives a vehicle, one of them distracts the staff, or shields the one putting the goods away so they can't be seen, Horst told DW. Sometimes so-called depots are set up in the store, where all the goods are packed in a bag, and then someone else carries it out in a surreptitious moment. The survey does not include exact breakdowns of the kinds of articles that get stolen, but Horst says that thieves often target anything small, expensive, and that can be easily re-sold, such as perfume and cosmetics. There had also been a rise in the theft of foods, especially relatively expensive things like meats and cheeses. But Nicole Bögelein, a criminologist at Cologne University, cast doubt on how useful the study actually is. She told DW that the researchers estimate that 98% of cases aren't even discovered. So it's just an assumption that the majority of these losses can be attributed to theft, she said. Bögelein also cast doubt on the EHI's conclusion that there are more organized shoplifting gangs, as that could simply be because store detectives are more on the lookout for such groups. 'Poverty crimes' Despite its shortcomings, the annual EHI survey is one of the few shoplifting studies there are, and it is focused mostly on the economic impact. Bögelein, by training a sociologist as well as a criminologist, has a different perspective and says that almost all cases of shoplifting are so-called poverty crimes — defined as crimes that don't cost any money to carry out, and are committed by people because they have no money. Bögelein's own investigations into shoplifting have found that the people who are caught are often poor — possibly, she says, also because store detectives are more likely to keep an eye on people who look poor. Official statistics suggest that the majority of thefts from shops are relatively petty. According to German federal police statistics, in 66.7% of discovered and prosecuted thefts, the value of the items stolen was under €50 and in 40.2% of cases even under €15. The punishment is usually a small fine, or, if the fine can't or won't be paid, a prison sentence. Germany a 'paradise' for shoplifters? Horst described Germany as a paradise for shoplifters, as the punishments are often relatively mild. Though theoretically thieves can be imprisoned for up to five years, he said that in practice first-time offenders are often not charged at all. Bögelein said that deterrence might have an effect on some minor thefts, but was generally skeptical of the idea that more punishment discourages petty crime. People don't not steal because they're scared of punishment, she argued. In criminology, we find that people stick to rules because they think those rules are correct and because they fear a bad conscience if they don't stick to them. Public transport operators in Germany often charge people a fee for riding without a ticket, but may also press charges, especially for repeat offenders.Image: picture-alliance/dpa/J. Wolf Should shoplifting be decriminalized in Germany? There has been a debate among German criminologists about to what extent poverty crimes should be decriminalized altogether, on the grounds that such crimes are usually victimless and therefore don't require criminal justice. There have long been calls to downgrade one classic poverty crime — riding public transport without a ticket — to a misdemeanor, partly because punishing it has become a burden to public coffers and is clogging up the justice system. Between 8,000 and 9,000 people end up in prison in Germany every year for riding without a ticket. But Horst argued that shoplifting shouldn't always be defined as a poverty crime: The EHI estimates that two-thirds of shoplifting cases were what he called opportunistic perpetrators, and many of them are not necessarily poor. Horst does think that inflation and higher prices for basic items may be playing a role in the rise of shoplifting, but he was reluctant to accept that poverty was the driving element of all theft. It could be a protest theft, because people are saying they're not prepared to accept the price rises for a particular product, he said, I'm sure poverty is a part of it, but that it explains the rise on its own — I don't see that.

The latest study by Germany's Retail Institute (EHI) on inventory differences shows that the vast majority of those losses (€4.2 billion) was down to theft from customers, employees, or delivery workers, the EHI said, which would mean losses of some €570 million to the public purse through lost sales tax. The EHI also said that retailers had to resort to balancing out their losses and the costs of extra security by increasing prices. Study author Frank Horst calculated that some 1.5% of prices in stores could now be attributed to covering theft and security. Shoplifting techniques The EHI said there had also been a 5% increase in organized shoplifting, which accounted for a third of the total shoplifting losses. Horst said this could be individual thieves working their way through a shopping list, or else, the thefts could be carried out by coordinated groups. One of them drives a vehicle, one of them distracts the staff, or shields the one putting the goods away so they can't be seen, Horst told DW. Sometimes so-called depots are set up in the store, where all the goods are packed in a bag, and then someone else carries it out in a surreptitious moment. The survey does not include exact breakdowns of the kinds of articles that get stolen, but Horst says that thieves often target anything small, expensive, and that can be easily re-sold, such as perfume and cosmetics. There had also been a rise in the theft of foods, especially relatively expensive things like meats and cheeses. But Nicole Bögelein, a criminologist at Cologne University, cast doubt on how useful the study actually is. She told DW that the researchers estimate that 98% of cases aren't even discovered. So it's just an assumption that the majority of these losses can be attributed to theft, she said. Bögelein also cast doubt on the EHI's conclusion that there are more organized shoplifting gangs, as that could simply be because store detectives are more on the lookout for such groups. 'Poverty crimes' Despite its shortcomings, the annual EHI survey is one of the few shoplifting studies there are, and it is focused mostly on the economic impact. Bögelein, by training a sociologist as well as a criminologist, has a different perspective and says that almost all cases of shoplifting are so-called poverty crimes — defined as crimes that don't cost any money to carry out, and are committed by people because they have no money. Bögelein's own investigations into shoplifting have found that the people who are caught are often poor — possibly, she says, also because store detectives are more likely to keep an eye on people who look poor. Official statistics suggest that the majority of thefts from shops are relatively petty. According to German federal police statistics, in 66.7% of discovered and prosecuted thefts, the value of the items stolen was under €50 and in 40.2% of cases even under €15. The punishment is usually a small fine, or, if the fine can't or won't be paid, a prison sentence. Germany a 'paradise' for shoplifters? Horst described Germany as a paradise for shoplifters, as the punishments are often relatively mild. Though theoretically thieves can be imprisoned for up to five years, he said that in practice first-time offenders are often not charged at all. Bögelein said that deterrence might have an effect on some minor thefts, but was generally skeptical of the idea that more punishment discourages petty crime. People don't not steal because they're scared of punishment, she argued. In criminology, we find that people stick to rules because they think those rules are correct and because they fear a bad conscience if they don't stick to them. Public transport operators in Germany often charge people a fee for riding without a ticket, but may also press charges, especially for repeat offenders.Image: picture-alliance/dpa/J. Wolf Should shoplifting be decriminalized in Germany? There has been a debate among German criminologists about to what extent poverty crimes should be decriminalized altogether, on the grounds that such crimes are usually victimless and therefore don't require criminal justice. There have long been calls to downgrade one classic poverty crime — riding public transport without a ticket — to a misdemeanor, partly because punishing it has become a burden to public coffers and is clogging up the justice system. Between 8,000 and 9,000 people end up in prison in Germany every year for riding without a ticket. But Horst argued that shoplifting shouldn't always be defined as a poverty crime: The EHI estimates that two-thirds of shoplifting cases were what he called opportunistic perpetrators, and many of them are not necessarily poor. Horst does think that inflation and higher prices for basic items may be playing a role in the rise of shoplifting, but he was reluctant to accept that poverty was the driving element of all theft. It could be a protest theft, because people are saying they're not prepared to accept the price rises for a particular product, he said, I'm sure poverty is a part of it, but that it explains the rise on its own — I don't see that.

Why is there a market for her content in the Balkan country and how are some Bulgarians fighting it?https://p.dw.com/p/4vrvKOn her social media profiles, Bulgarian influencer Zornitsa Gyutsova posts misogynistic advice about how men should 'deal with' womenImage: Zgyutsova/TikTokAdvertisement Women love men who can be violent if need be. That's why they like men who hit them, Bulgarian influencer Zornitsa Gyutsova tells her followers. Gyutsova suggests that not only do women prefer men who physically assault them, but that this is also the way men should behave because a woman should respect a man's physical power since she is unable to comprehend his intellectual power. This is the kind of advice that can be found on Gyutsova's social media profiles and in a private group founded by her on Telegram called Upstanding Man. 'Equality is contrary to human nature' Zornitsa Gyutsova offers her followers private chats over video where she teaches them how to deal with women — for a fee, of course. Many influencers, life coaches and other online personalities in Bulgaria and elsewhere offer private sessions or courses. What makes Gyutsova's content stand out from the rest is that its sole purpose is to explain to men that they need to learn to control their partners both psychologically and, if necessary, physically.There have been numerous protests against violence against women in Bulgaria in recent years, such as this one in 2023Image: Alexandar Detev/DW In Gyutsova's view, men in general have been treated badly by women, and women are the ones who exert violence on men, namely by not paying them enough respect. The idea of equality is like a worm in people's brains that insists men and women should be partners […] which is so contrary to human nature that it can never work, Gyutsova declared in a long video about her work that was broadcast on Bulgarian National Television. Although the broadcaster, which is partly financed by taxpayer's money, has since removed the video from its platforms, it has never publicly commented on the case. Huge backlash Gyutsova's profiles on social media have been gaining traction for several years now. Screenshots and videos from her private Telegram group chat recently surfaced on social media, triggering a huge backlash in Bulgaria. Local woman Petya Krasteva was so appalled by Gyutsova's online content that she filed a complaint against Gyutsova with the prosecutor's office. On her social media channels, she not only encourages people to degrade women and use violence against them, she also boasts that she uses the same methods on her child and her cat, she told DW. I thought to myself: This is not only absolutely unacceptable, it's criminal. Gender discrimination not a crime in Bulgaria Many other women did the same as Krasteva, only to find out a couple of weeks later that their efforts had been in vain.Petya Krasteva was appalled by Zornitsa Gyutsova's online content and filed a complaint against her with the prosecutor's officeImage: Nikola Gyulmezov In an official reply, the prosecutor's office stated that nothing could be done because Bulgaria's criminal code does not define gender discrimination as a crime and that the issue was a matter for the Commission against Discrimination. Krasteva promptly lodged a complaint with this commission, but received another negative answer based on the same reasoning. Profiles briefly taken down Although these complaints did not lead to charges being brought against Gyutsova, the backlash did have an impact. The outcry and the fact that Gyutsova's social media accounts were reported by people who found their content abhorrent, meant that the influencer's TikTok and Instagram profiles were deactivated. They were, however, reactivated a short time later. Impunity for abusers Krasteva feels that part of the reason why content like Gyutsova's strikes a chord in Bulgaria is that while patriarchal norms and domestic violence are not accepted in the country, Bulgarian society often turns a blind eye to them. The other huge problem, she says, is that as with many other social issues, there is a complete lack of consequences for the perpetrators. Valentina Dimitrova, a psychologist who works for the Emprove Foundation, a Bulgarian organization that supports women who have suffered domestic violence, holds a similar view.Psychologist Valentina Dimitrova says that content like Gyutsova's is dangerous because 'it can truly cost a human life'Image: Venera Velkovska Sadly it's embedded in the Bulgarian mindset that we often just accept that things are bad and we do nothing about it, says Dimitrova. She believes that this is also why many women stay in violent relationships: They simply have no faith in the authorities because time and time again, men who beat or even kill their partners face no legal consequences. Although some people seem to think that social media content is less problematic than actual abuse in real life, Dimitrova stresses the dangers associated with such content: It can truly cost a human life. A global online problem Misogynistic online content that paints women as lesser human beings and men as oppressed by women is not unique to Bulgaria. Such content has been growing and spreading all over the world in recent years. Influencers like Andrew Tate, who faces charges of rape, bodily harm, human trafficking and more, have created a whole movement around this sort of content. Gyutsova fits neatly into this category of influencer, but what makes her different is that she is a woman. What role does feminism play? Dimitrova thinks one issue here is that feminism is often misunderstood. Feminism does not entail men being suppressed and women controlling them. It means that women can have equal rights and can function as equals to men not only in society but also in their personal relationships, she says. Dimitrova also believes that the patriarchal notion that men should not be allowed to express emotions is highly problematic. This is reflected in Gyutsova's content, which suggests that men are weak and not manly if they dare to express their fears, emotions or feelings.People in Sofia attend a protest against domestic violence and violence against women in Bulgaria in 2023 after a young woman was stabbed by her ex-partner Image: Alexandar Detev/DW It's a vicious circle: Men who are not allowed to express any sort of emotion for fear of being labeled weak don't know what to do when they experience something frustrating in their relationships and so they resort to aggression, says Dimitrova. What can be done? Dimitrova suggests that first and foremost, men should receive support and their concerns should not just be swept under the carpet. She stresses, however, that this support should not validate the inclination to deal with problems by exerting psychological or physical violence on women. Although the Emprove Foundation focuses primarily on women's rights and issues, it does have a project that focuses on men's mental health — something the foundation says is incredibly important in the fight against gender-based violence. Men should be encouraged to connect to a healthy understanding of themselves, so they can build healthy relationships as well, says Dimitrova. Petya Krasteva firmly believes that even though authorities in Bulgaria rarely provide the support needed in cases like this, society should not remain indifferent. We should be as loud as possible when something like this turns up, she says. We should be perfectly clear that it is unacceptable. That way, other people who come across this content will know that this is not something that society approves of, and that could help them realize that they shouldn't have anything to do with it. Dimitrova agrees. We will keep talking about it [this kind of content], calling it out and not tolerating it until the authorities wake up.

The list includes not only Myanmar's military leader Min Aung Hlaing, but also former State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and former President Htin Kyaw. Suu Kyi effectively served as Myanmar's top civilian leader before the military staged a coup in February 2021. She has been imprisoned ever since. The court in Argentina claims it has the jurisdiction to order a warrant for Suu Kyi's arrest based on a legal principle that some serious crimes can be prosecuted regardless of where they were committed. The specific case focuses on discrimination against Myanmar's Rohingya ethnic minority. The Muslim Rohingya live predominantly in the western state of Rakhine, and their status as citizens and as an ethnic group recognized by the state of Myanmar has been disputed for decades. The Rohingya crisis of 2017 Since 1988, Myanmar has seen an ongoing political conflict between the military and military-backed parties on one side and Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, on the other. In 2016, after many years of stalemate, the military and Aung San Suu Kyi reached a truce. A kind of dual government was established, with Aung San Suu Kyi heading the civilian branch and Min Aung Hlaing heading the military, which had constitutionally secured independence and far-reaching political rights. On October 9, 2016, Rohingya insurgents attacked several border and police posts of the Myanmar security forces. In August 2017, the security forces launched so-called clearance operations. As a result, thousands of Rohingya were killed and around 700,000 fled to neighboring Bangladesh, with exact figures still unclear due to the nature of the ethnically-charged conflict. Rohingya refugees fear increased hardship due to aid cutsTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video While the military denied using excessive force, international watchdogs and the UN agree that Myanmar's actions against the Rohingya constitute grave human rights violations. Still, two questions remain: First, did the offensive amount to genocide? Second, how much of it was the responsibility of Aung San Suu Kyi? The question of genocide Concerns that a genocide was happening in Myanmar have already been voiced before 2017. In 2015, the human rights organization Fortify Rights published a report with the Allard K. Lovenstein International Human Rights Clinic from Yale Law School in which was stated that there is strong evidence that genocide is being committed against Rohingya. Those voices only grew louder after 2017, and in November 2019, Gambia initiated a case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Myanmar, claiming violations of the UN's Genocide Convention. The ICJ has yet to rule on the case, however, meaning that the existence of genocide remains unconfirmed in a legal sense. But for human rights organizations like Fortify Rights, the Burmese-Rohingya Organization UK (BROUK) and the former UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar, Tomas Ojea Quintana, there is no doubt that genocide did take place. Quintana, an Argentinian, told Radio Free Asia that the court in his native country understood what was at stake, which is the genocide against the Rohingya people. The question of responsibility Aung San Suu Kyi was a globally renowned human rights advocate since the early 1990s until the events of 2017. She was also heading Myanmar's civilian government during the deadly wave of violence against the Rohingya. As chief councilor, she was notably hesitant to speak out against the military and even went to The Hague in 2019 to defend Myanmar at the International Court of Justice. She denied genocide was happening in Rakhine but admitted human rights violations, which would be investigated by Myanmar. She later confirmed this position in an interview with the Financial Times. War crimes were committed during the internal armed conflict with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army by members of Myanmar's security forces and civilians, she told the paper. At the same time, Aung San Suu Kyi pointed to a report by the Independent Commission of Enquiry (ICOE) which was set up by Myanmar without Rohingya representatives. The ICOE found no evidence of genocide, she told the paper, despite its report recording killing of civilians, disproportionate use of force, looting of property, and destruction of abandoned homes of Muslims. For those who believe Myanmar troops committed genocide against the Rohingya, Aung San Suu Kyi's refusal to recognize it makes her complicit. But does her stance — admitting that human rights violations happened but not genocide — mean Aung San Suu Kyi is guilty of committing genocide? What do we know about the Argentinian court order? The reasons behind the Argentinian court's decision to seek an international arrest warrant are not fully clear, as neither the ruling nor the exact evidence on which the ruling was based are publicly available. DW contacted the Argentinian court and the Argentinian human rights commission to get more information in the matter, but received no reply. The 2021 coup triggered protests in Myanmar, which eventually escalated into a civil war.Image: Sai Aung Main/AFP In the months following the announcement, Myanmar expert and former ambassador Derek Tonkin published an academic paper on the issue, examining the sources which most likely led to the arrest warrant. He writes that the petition [on which the decision of the court seems to be based] contains much narrative and opinion which are debatable and questionable, and in some areas are simply wrong. Commenting on the claim that Aung San Suu Kyi and others validated the genocide against the Rohingya, Tonkin states, it is not true and is supported by no evidence anywhere in the petition. Tonkin also rejects the accusation that Aung San Suu Kyi was directly responsible for the events in Rakhine State during her time as state counsellor at the time. I find this totally unconvincing. The Tatmadaw [the Myanmar military] refused to accept Aung San Suu Kyi's appointment, he writes. So far, the arrest warrant hasn't had any impact. Aung San Suu Kyi seems set to celebrate her 80th birthday next month as a prisoner in Myanmar as the civil war rages on. With the passage of time, the international arrest warrant might end up as a mere footnote in a long political career filled with legal battles.

They identified the deceased as Sandeep and Arif, residents of the B block area in Khayala. According to the police, a call was received from Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hospital to the Khayala police station about two men admitted with stab injuries between 10 pm and 11 pm. They both succumbed to injuries in the early hours of Monday. “As per the information available so far, two friends, who have known each other for years, were sitting in the park. An argument over something started between them, and it escalated to a scuffle. During the brawl, both of them stabbed each other using sharp-edged weapons,” said Vichitra Veer, Deputy Commissioner of Police, West. According to a police officer, neighbours saw the men lying injured in the park and rushed them to the hospital. Sandeep worked as a property dealer and previously as a gym trainer, said the police, adding that both men were married and had children. The park where the two were sitting was under the jurisdiction of Tilak Nagar police station. Teams from both Khayala and Tilak Nagar stations are now investigating the matter. The police are now questioning the neighbours and family members of the deceased to find the cause of the conflict between the two. They are reviewing CCTV footage from the area to establish the sequence of events. The bodies have been preserved for postmortem at the DDU Hospital Monday. Meanwhile, the Delhi Police crime data shows that 107 cases of murder were reported between January 1 and March 31 in 2025, a slight uptick from 105 in 2024 during the same period, but lower than 2023, when it was 115.

Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Mohali Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Harmandeep Singh Hans, said several special teams were constituted to trace the rising number of heinous crimes in the district. The operation was led by SP (Operations) Talwinder Singh, SP (PBI) Deepika Singh, DSP (City-2) Harsimran Singh Bal, and DSP (Economic Offences) Rajesh. Under this operation SHO Amandeep Singh and inspectors Gabbar Singh and Gagandeep carried out an investigation based on an FIR registered on July 12. According to the complainant, the incident occurred during the night of July 11–12, when she was returning from Best Tech Mall after watching a movie with her friend. Near Lakhnour turn, four bike-borne youths, dressed in Nihang attire, intercepted their car. The miscreants forcibly dragged her out of the vehicle and kidnapped her friend before fleeing the scene in the stolen car, the complaint stated. The SSP said that after assaulting the kidnapped boy, the accused threw him about 100 meters away. They then fled with the girl, kept her with them for approximately 30 minutes and later pushed her out near a gate before escaping towards Ambala. SSP Hans identified the arrested accused as Shamsher Singh, a resident of Gurdaspur; Satnam Singh (from Ludhiana), who works as a cab driver; Nirmal Singh (Nawanshahr), employed as a security guard; and Chander Mohan, alias Jaildar (Jammu), who also works as a security guard, All four were residing at a PG located behind Gurdwara Singh Shaheedan, Sohana in Mohali. Acting on a tip-off, police put the entire district on high alert. Multiple teams were deployed and after analysing the CCTV footage, the stolen vehicle was successfully traced. The accused were arrested from Chanarthal village under Sahabad police station, and the looted car was recovered. “These accused may be involved in other criminal cases as well. Interrogation is underway, and more revelations are expected,” Hans added.",7f251a7091a932c843ffae68035733e3ed5734782bce2e0aba302a91473a43d5,e9ffc2dbb5d1b5a0c5b8fd59dc708464

Sanjay Verma was shot dead on Monday at around 10 am, right outside his showroom in Abohar. According to eyewitnesses, three motorcycle-borne assailants lay in wait for him. The moment Verma stepped out of his car, they opened indiscriminate fire, killing him on the spot before fleeing the scene. While the shooters escaped and have yet to be identified, the Punjab Police announced the arrest of two of their accomplices, Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan, both residents of Patiala district, for helping the shooters escape in the car. However, within hours, both men were killed in a police encounter. This development has added fuel to the controversy. BJP General Secretary Manjinder Singh Sirsa accused the Punjab government of mishandling the law and order situation. On his visit to Chandigarh Wednesday, Sirsa said, “First of all, the Punjab government is not able to control the law and order and criminals… Punjab has become a police state. If Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has a clean image, he should get a CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) inquiry conducted into these encounters so the truth comes out.” Reacting sharply, AAP’s Punjab state president Aman Arora called the BJP’s stance “extremely shameful,” accusing it of siding with gangsters instead of supporting Verma’s bereaved family. Arora said, “While the entire Punjab stands with the family of Shri Sanjay Verma, Manjinder Singh Sirsa’s open support for gangsters today proves that the BJP is backing criminals even through central jails.” After meeting the family of Sanjay Verma on Monday, Arora had stated that gangsters lodged in jails outside Punjab were behind such heinous criminal activities. Whereas, Union Minister of State Ravneet Singh Bittu held the Mann government responsible for the ‘growing fear and lawlessness’ across Punjab. “Instead of owning up to their failure, AAP leaders are shamelessly pointing fingers at the Centre. This is not governance –it’s a complete abdication of duty,” he added. Bittu called Arora’s remarks “irresponsible” and “highly condemnable,” accusing him of trying to deflect attention from the AAP government’s failure to maintain law and order in the state. In a statement released on Monday, Bittu announced that he would write to the Governor of Punjab, urging him to take cognisance of Arora’s “baseless allegations”. He also sought written clarifications from Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav and Chief Secretary KAP Sinha, questioning whether Arora’s statement reflected the official position of the Bhagwant Mann-led government. “Aman Arora’s claim that gangster Lawrence Bishnoi is safe in Gujarat under the Centre’s protection is nothing but an excuse to hide the AAP government’s incompetence. These kinds of inflammatory and misleading remarks are both dangerous and unacceptable,” said Bittu. He reaffirmed that the central government has always taken a tough stance against terrorism and organised crime. “We conducted surgical strikes inside Pakistan when needed. Do you think gangsters are beyond our reach? Once the BJP forms government in Punjab, we’ll show what decisive action really looks like,” Bittu said. Pointing to the killing of Sanjay Verma, Bittu accused the Punjab government of completely surrendering to the gangster nexus. “Extortion threats and targeted killings have become the new normal for Punjab’s business community,” he said. Adding to the political slugfest, AAP’s Abohar constituency in-charge Arun Narang displayed a photo showing Abohar MLA Sandeep Jakhar with Shakti, a bike driver allegedly linked to the murder. Sandeep Jakhar, who is a suspended Congress MLA and nephew of Punjab BJP chief Sunil Jakhar, clarified that the picture was from the 2022 assembly election campaign. “Many people get pictures taken with us during campaigns. It’s illogical to link that picture to this crime,” he said. ‘We have full trust’ Jagat Verma, elder brother of Sanjay Verma, has expressed satisfaction over the police probe. In a video, Jagat Verma said, “We have full trust in the Punjab Police and we are satisfied with the ongoing police investigation. We humbly appeal to one and all to please stop doing politics over this issue. We appeal to the police to nab the rest of the culprits soon… We trust that we will get justice soon.” State of probe The police said their investigations have revealed that the getaway bike was driven by one Shakti, a daily wager from Azimgarh village of Abohar. While escaping, the attackers lost control of their bike and forcibly snatched another two-wheeler. They later abandoned it on Seeto Road and allegedly fled in a waiting Swift car, driven by Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan. Jaspreet Singh’s family has denied any involvement, alleging that he was picked up from his house in Mardankheri village of Patiala during the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday, and that they later received news of his death. They maintain that Jaspreet was a daily wager with no criminal background. The police said Jaspreet had a criminal background, and released a few pictures of him brandishing weapons. The details of his criminal record haven’t been revealed as of now. At the time of filing this report, the postmortem examination of Jaspreet and Ram was underway at the Abohar Civil Hospital under strict police cover. Meanwhile, gangster Aarzoo Bishnoi had claimed responsibility for the murder on social media, tagging Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar and Maharashtra’s Shivam Lonker hours after the murder. After the alleged encounter, Bishnoi again posted that the real shooters remained at large, and that Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan had no role in the killing. The Punjab unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has identified the Lawrence Bishnoi gang as the perpetrators behind this crime. The police, however, have not confirmed these claims nor provided clarity on the identities of the actual shooters.",e5f95abfc958db5d8cdbca385844d557be4c91c691308cd7d60da76720ec2964,110f9aeaaf40f7b999bac5a862114640

Their online conversations quickly grew into what seemed like a genuine relationship, and soon, talks of marriage followed. But the connection, which appeared to promise a shared future, turned out to be an elaborate cyber scam in which he was allegedly duped of a staggering Rs 1.55 crore over eight months. The investigation revealed that the cybercriminals, operating behind the profile of ‘Anamika,’ gradually gained the complainant’s trust and allegedly requested large sums of money. On the pretence of building a future together, ‘Anamika’ allegedly convinced him to transfer funds to purchase a house without ever having met. Over time, the scammers further manipulated him into investing in various trading apps, luring him with promises of exceptionally high returns, said the police. After spending nearly all his life savings and facing further demands for more money, he realised he had been deceived. When he tried to recover his funds, ‘Anamika’ allegedly abruptly stopped all communication with him. The police filed an FIR in March based on his complaint. The investigation by the cybercrime police station in Pimpri Chinchwad unearthed an elaborate network of mule account handlers allegedly operating from Solapur and with links to cybercriminals masterminding these scams from China. The police zeroed in on one particular mule account registered in Solapur in June. As the account holder was questioned, he spilled the beans on three others from Solapur who had allegedly told him that his bank account would be used for taking funds obtained from gaming applications. As the investigation dug deeper into these three suspects, the police established their identities and roles in the racket. The mule account handlers from Solapur have been identified as Shubham Chandrakant Mantha, 25, a resident of Ashok Chowk; Swapnil Chandulal Baheti, 35, a resident of Hotgi Road; and Prashik Uttam Navghare, 26, a resident of Juna Kumbhani Naka. “Our investigation revealed that Mantha worked for a China-headquartered payment application company, and he and Baheti were in direct contact with the masterminds based out of China. A coordinated search operation was launched for the trio as their roles were confirmed in the probe,” an officer who was part of the probe said. In the second week of June, Mantha and Navghare were arrested from Pune International Airport when they were about to flee to Nepal via Patna. Baheti, too, was placed under arrest. “Investigation revealed an elaborate mule handling and fund siphoning operation with direct links to China,” said an officer. All three suspects are currently in judicial custody.",9865caa283c9b9ddd31c4f3ac55f1c88767cac6e0a52108d705b0426b1b3413e,d113295a560ee830400d4ef5003f9379

The victim, identified as Sanjeev, 19, a resident of Rajiv Colony, Panchkula, had reportedly come to the area to meet a friend when he was attacked. According to police officials, Sanjeev was surrounded by three to four individuals around 10.30 pm. He was stabbed multiple times in the chest and abdomen with a knife, and then left critically injured on the roadside. The assailants fled the scene immediately after the attack. Soon after, a crowd gathered at the spot, and the PCR was informed. Sanjeev was rushed to the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, Chandigarh, where he succumbed to his injuries during treatment, the police said. The Chandigarh Police have apprehended two minors in connection with the crime. “An FIR has been registered, and the two juveniles have been booked for murder. They will be sent to a juvenile home,” said Vijay Singh, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Chandigarh Police. Sources revealed that the accused allegedly attacked Sanjeev because he was reportedly stalking their sister. The police have not ruled out the involvement of more individuals and are continuing their investigation. Meanwhile, the preliminary postmortem report has stated that the victim died due to punctured vital organs caused by the stabbings. The incident has triggered tension in the area, with residents demanding increased police patrolling and swift justice. Teenager injured in stabbing attack in Sector 40 A 19-year-old teenager was critically injured in a targeted stabbing attack by a group of around half a dozen minors in Block C of Sector 40 in Chandigarh on Sunday night. The assault is suspected to be a result of personal enmity. According to the police, the attackers arrived on three to four motorbikes and were not wearing helmets. They attacked the youth and fled the scene within seconds. The victim was initially rushed by his family members to a private hospital in Mohali, but was later shifted to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, Chandigarh. Chiranji Lal, Station House Officer (SHO), Sector-39 Police Station, confirmed that the attack appeared to be premeditated and due to a personal dispute. The condition of the victim is stable, he added. Efforts are underway to trace the suspects. The accused are all minors, said the SHO.",b0d6e7aff031ee66a6a91c3cfe94f608d6d756f573b6c8344e68aa9c40b83612,a974bdead49b7c89b18ff058176c3d87

But when public figures cross legal lines, the consequences unfold not just in courtrooms but also under the relentless scrutiny of the public eye. One name that recently forced this uncomfortable truth into the spotlight is Sean “Diddy” Combs, the hip-hop mogul and music industry titan who, after years of whispers and lawsuits, has now been convicted in a federal court. In July 2025, a jury found Combs guilty on two felony counts of transportation to engage in prostitution under the Mann Act, a law dating back to 1910. These charges relate to the coerced travel of his former partner, singer Cassie Ventura, and another woman identified only as “Jane,” both of whom testified during the trial. Combs was acquitted on three other charges, including racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking. Still, the guilty verdict marks a seismic fall for the 55-year-old artist once synonymous with glamour, success, and cultural dominance. Diddy’s story is far from unique. Over the years, several A-listers have been convicted of crimes — from drug possession and assault to manslaughter and tax evasion. This listicle delves into 10 high-profile celebrities with criminal records, focusing only on those with confirmed legal outcomes. Once a towering figure in global music, Diddy’s legacy has been rocked by criminal convictions. In a 2025 federal trial, he was found guilty of two counts of transporting women – including ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura – for prostitution, under the Mann Act. Though acquitted of more serious charges like racketeering and sex trafficking, the felony convictions carry serious legal and reputational consequences. More fallout may follow. Attorney Tony Buzbee claims over 100 men and women have accused Diddy of rape and assault. One woman alleged she was gang raped at age 17 after being drugged at a 2003 party. While Combs’s team dismisses the lawsuits as publicity stunts, the convictions have added weight to the mounting allegations. Sanjay Dutt’s conviction remains one of the most talked-about legal sagas in Indian cinema. In 1993, following the devastating Mumbai bomb blasts, Dutt was arrested under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) for illegally possessing an AK-56 rifle, which was part of a consignment linked to the bombings. Though he was acquitted of terrorism charges, he was convicted in 2006 under the Arms Act for illegal possession of firearms. After years of legal proceedings and appeals, Dutt was sentenced to five years in prison and ultimately served over four years, including time at Yerwada Central Jail. Before becoming Tony Stark, Robert Downey Jr. was one of Hollywood’s most tragic cautionary tales. Struggling with addiction in the 90s, Downey was repeatedly arrested for possession of heroin, cocaine, and unlicensed firearms. He was famously found wandering into a neighbour’s house under the influence and passed out in their bed. In 1999, after multiple probation violations, he was sentenced to three years in prison, though he served roughly a year before early release. In 2009, Bollywood actor Shiney Ahuja was arrested for raping his domestic help—a case that sent shockwaves through the film industry. Though the victim later recanted her statement, the court found the original testimony credible and convicted Ahuja in 2011 under Section 376 (rape) and other charges. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, though he spent about three years in jail before being released on bail pending appeal. Wesley Snipes’ high-flying Hollywood career hit a wall when he was convicted in 2008 on three misdemeanor counts of failing to file federal income tax returns. Prosecutors claimed he hadn’t paid taxes for years, despite earning tens of millions. Though he was acquitted of the more severe felony tax fraud charges, he still served nearly three years in prison. In 1992, boxing champion Mike Tyson was convicted of raping 18-year-old Desiree Washington, a beauty pageant contestant, in an incident that took place at a hotel in Indianapolis in July 1991. The jury found Tyson guilty after about 10 hours of deliberation, rejecting his defense that the encounter was consensual. Tyson was sentenced to six years in prison and served approximately three years before being released on parole in 1995. The conviction shocked the sports world and dramatically altered Tyson’s public image overnight, marking a significant turning point in his career. Despite this setback, Tyson later returned to the boxing ring and expanded his career into entertainment, including notable acting roles such as in The Hangover film series. In 2001, Stranger Things star Winona Ryder was arrested for shoplifting over $5,500 worth of merchandise from a Beverly Hills Saks Fifth Avenue store. She was later convicted of felony grand theft and vandalism, receiving three years’ probation, 480 hours of community service, and fines. The incident damaged her career for years, leading to a hiatus from leading roles in Hollywood. Ryder eventually made a well-received comeback, and her 2000s-era troubles are now often seen as part of the conversation around mental health and celebrity pressure. Shia LaBeouf is known for his acting talent as well as his history of erratic behaviour and legal troubles. Over the years, he has been arrested multiple times for offenses such as disorderly conduct, public intoxication, and drunk driving. One of the most notable incidents occurred in 2017, when LaBeouf was arrested in Savannah, Georgia, for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. During this arrest, he was caught on camera making a racially charged outburst toward police officers. These incidents, along with other arrests for similar behavior, have contributed to his reputation for instability. LaBeouf has also faced civil lawsuits from former partners, most prominently from singer FKA Twigs, who accused him of sexual battery and emotional abuse. While he has not been criminally convicted in these civil cases, the combination of his legal issues and public controversies has overshadowed his career achievements, leading many to view him as a cautionary example of wasted potential in Hollywood. Before becoming a blockbuster actor and producer, Mark Wahlberg had a violent and troubling past. At 16, Wahlberg was charged with attempted murder after assaulting two Vietnamese men during a racially motivated attack. He was convicted of assault and served 45 days in prison. The case drew renewed attention in 2014 when Wahlberg applied for a pardon, sparking criticism from civil rights groups and raising questions about accountability and privilege. Wahlberg has publicly acknowledged his past and expressed remorse, though his request for a pardon was ultimately dropped. Phil Spector, the music genius behind the Wall of Sound, became infamous for a far more sinister reason. In 2009, he was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2003 death of actress Lana Clarkson, who was found shot in his mansion. The trial, his second, after a hung jury, ended in a conviction and a 19-years-to-life prison sentence.

The doctor received two bullet injuries, and his condition is critical, they said. Ajay Gandhi, Senior Superintendent of Police, Moga, said Dr Aniljit Kamboj, who is in his fifties, was shot at by two men who came to his Harbans Nursing Home at around 2 pm. “The doctor was treating one of them, and discussing medicines when the second man who was standing behind opened fire. Two bullets hit the doctor, including one in the chest. He has been admitted to a private hospital in Moga, and his condition is critical. He is on ventilator,” Gandhi told The Indian Express. He said the police are probing the case from all angles, and checking CCTV footage to identify the suspects. A family member told The Indian Express that Kamboj had received extortion calls from Canada-based designated terrorist Lakhbir Singh Landa, an operative of the banned organization Babbar Khalsa International (BKI). The threat calls were being received since 2022 and the caller was demanding at least Rs 1 crore, said the family member, requesting anonymity. He further said that Kamboj was also given a security cover by the Moga Police but the lone gunman was withdrawn some months ago. Moga SP (investigation) Bal Krishan Singla, said: “An FIR was registered in 2022 after Dr Kamboj had received threat calls. Landa was nominated as an accused in that FIR. However, the family did not inform us about any such latest incident.” Asked if the security cover was withdrawn, he said: “They were having the security cover till some time ago but currently, they had no such threat perception. I would need to check the latest status of their security cover.” The CCTV footage of two suspects who shot Dr Aniljit Kamboj at his clinic in Moga district, Friday. The suspects posed as patients.

His blood pressure is not stable and he is on ventilator.” “My husband was at the clinic with him. Two men came and posed as patients. One of them told my father-in-law that he was having some skin related ailment. As soon as he bent down to check his leg, the other man who was standing behind opened fire at him,” she said. Inspector Gurwinder Singh Bhullar, SHO Kot Ise Khan, said that the case was being probed from all angles including Landa’s alleged involvement. “Prima facie, the man who opened fire had two weapons and he opened fire with both,” said the SHO. The inspector said that an FIR for attempt to murder was being registered at Kot Ise Khan police station on the statement of Chahat. “We will nominate names of the accused as the probe will progresses,” he said. “The doctor had received extortion calls in the past and was also given the security cover.

The deceased have been identified as dhaba owner Siddarodh Tugudi, 35, his nephew Jagadish Belamagi, 28, and employee Ramanna Bhosga, 40. The police said that the triple murders were in retaliation to a killing that occurred in November last year in connection with a feud between two families who belong to the same village. According to the police, Tugudi and his brothers had murdered a criminal identified as Somu Talikoti over a financial dispute and were released on bail recently. To avenge Talikot’s death, four of his brothers along with associates reportedly orchestrated Wednesday’s attack, the police said. “The police have been warning the families after the murder that took place last year. They belong to the same caste and are relatives. We suspect that these murders were carried out in revenge,” said Kalaburagi City Police Commissioner Sharanappa S D on Thursday. The assailants allegedly stormed the dhaba at 12.45 am, targeting Siddarodh and Jagadish, the police said, adding that they have recovered crucial CCTV footage from a nearby petrol station. The accused had damaged the CCTVs installed at the dhaba. “When the dhaba employees attempted to flee through the back door toward an agricultural field, the attackers pursued them. In the chaos, they killed Ramanna, mistaking him for one of Siddarodh’s brothers.

The accused were riding a motorcycle with a temporary number plate when they were intercepted by the police. Police said that the arrests are linked to the firing incident that took place on the intervening night of June 20-21. According to the complainant, Samdarsh Kumar, a resident of Ramdarbar and a property dealer, an unknown person had fired at his car parked outside his house, shattering a window pane.

The police have recovered one country-made pistol along with four live cartridges from Monu, and one country-made weapon with a live cartridge from Pawan. Monu has a criminal background and was previously involved in a 2022 murder case registered at PS 17, Chandigarh, police claimed.

The accused — Sandeep Jawahar Shah, a resident of Solapur, and Salim Khubbuddin Patel, a resident of Navi Mumbai — were arrested in Mumbai and Sangli earlier this month. As per the CBI, it discovered that the two were involved in duping NEET candidates and their parents by falsely claiming to have connections with officials of the National Testing Agency (NTA) that conducts the examination. As per the CBI, Shah initially demanded Rs 90 lakh from each candidate and agreed to accept Rs 87.5 lakh per candidate. The central agency claimed that Shah and Patel would assure candidates that they would receive details of their purportedly increased marks six hours before the official declaration of results. The accused sought to be released on bail on the grounds that probe was completed and their custodial interrogation was not required. The pleas claimed that there was no recovery at the instance of the applicants and they’ll co-operate with the trial after being released on bail. The CBI, however, opposed the pleas stating that the same be rejected as there other accused persons are yet to be arrested and therefore the custodial interrogation of present applicants would be required. However, special judge VP Desai observed that till date (on June 21) “the investigating officer has nothing concrete to show that till what period the other accused will be arrested”. Merely because the other accused persons are yet to be arrested cannot be a ground for rejection of the bail, the judge added. The court further noted that offence under section 7(A) of Prevention of the Corruption (PC) Act is not punishable in imprisonment of life or death and punishment prescribed is not less than three years but will extend to seven years. “Nothing is brought on record against the applicant that he will not be available for trial. Hence discretion in the nature of bail can be exercised in the favour of applicants,” the court held and granted bail to the two on furnishing personal bond of Rs 50,000 each along with other terms and conditions.",4974f52e05170329fc61b34918e72435efd9c5cfb80bb908d716d1ecea37e141,772d6209c825a13e8bd82758db7362e1

(ABC News: Nickoles Coleman)Inside the couple's suburban Brisbane home, the evidence of 39-year-old Ryan David Walker's unfinished work is obvious.Some of the skirting boards have been installed so poorly doors can't open and close.The work the couple paid for was never completed. (ABC News: Nickoles Coleman)Walker also left random holes drilled in the stairs, a half-completed cupboard, and a demolished wardrobe that was never rebuilt. You feel so hopeless, you know, we spent nearly eight grand [and] it was simple tasks, Ms James said.Saga begins with a cupboardThe couple found Walker on online platform Airtasker. (ABC: Bill Code)Ms James first visited the online platform Airtasker around September last year in search of someone who could build a hidden cupboard under the couple’s stairs.Most of the carpentry companies they had tried had turned down the work because it was too small.So, when Walker responded to their request with a plan they liked and quickly got to work, they were impressed with his professionalism. Ryan David Walker is unlicensed, according to QBCC. (Supplied: Linkedin)One job led to another and before long, the couple agreed to pay a deposit just shy of $8,000 for hanging some doors and building some wardrobes.They claim it was almost immediately after Walker received those funds that he essentially disappeared, leaving a trail of unfinished work in his wake. It's been incredibly frustrating with small children to have a house that's half pulled apart, Mr Jones said. We keep finding nails everywhere.

(ABC News: Alkira Reinfrank)In the meantime, Ms James has also reported Walker to the Office of Fair Trading and is exploring legal options.The OFT wouldn't comment on whether it had received any complaints in relation to Walker.Walker was sentenced to jail for fraud in the Brisbane District Court last month. (ABC News: Julie Hornsey)Jail term imposedComplicating their attempts to get their money back is the fact that Walker is currently behind bars – something the couple only discovered while searching online for avenues for recourse.He pleaded guilty to four separate fraud charges in the Brisbane District Court last month, admitting to having used a sub-contractor's licence number to forge a contract, and subsequently accepting more than $100,000 in payments for work he wasn't completing.Walker laid the blame for his offending with his gambling addiction in the Brisbane District Court last month. (Getty Images: scyther5)Walker told the court a gambling addiction had led to his offending, and that he was concerned a jail term would delay his ability to pay his victims back.He also told Judge Michael Burnett he had been gainfully employed while court proceedings had been ongoing.His four-year jail term, imposed on June 20, will be suspended after six months.Smaller jobs targeted by unlicensed operatorsMr Bidwell says the state's builder licensing system is among the most robust in the country. (ABC News: Glen Armstrong)While Master Builders Queensland CEO Paul Bidwell says stories like this are relatively rare, he acknowledged it isn’t unusual to see unlicensed contractors coming out of the woodwork , particularly after natural disasters and offering smaller repairs.Mr Bidwell is concerned these operators are doing damage to the industry's reputation and making it difficult for people to trust tradies. The reality is, when push comes to shove, that people will be convinced to take an easy option, he said. If it sounds too good to be true, then it is too good to be true. Mr Bidwell says natural disasters can entice unlicensed operators out of the woodwork to offer their services. (ABC Gold Coast: Alexandria Utting)'Robust' system in placeQueensland has had a licensing system for trades since 1991, and a licence is required in most cases if the works to be completed are worth more than $3,300.Mr Bidwell described it as one of the most robust in the country, which in theory means no-one should be performing building work without a licence.But he said the onus is on would-be renovators to check the licences of tradespeople. Don't take anything at face value, he said. Have a look at their record through the QBCC ... they can see whether the carpenter has had any directions. There's nothing like getting references from people you know to make sure that the contractor can deliver what they say they can do. CEO of Master Builders Queensland Paul Bidwell warns would-be renovators should be wary of offers which sound too good to be true. (ABC News: Glen Armstrong)A QBCC search of Ryan David Walker reveals he is unlicensed.It also shows he has previously been disqualified and has had infringements issued for unlicensed contracting in the past.The record also reveals he declared bankruptcy in 2024.A spokesperson for QBCC says people should look up tradespeople before they engage their services. (Supplied: QBCC)Warning for would-be renovatorsQBCC declined the ABC's request for an interview. In a statement, a spokesperson said home owners should check the licensee register before engaging a tradesperson. In addition, having a written, dated and signed contract in place isn’t just smart, it’s an essential part of the process and can safeguard you if things go wrong, they said.QBCC said people would generally be covered under their home warranty scheme if they enter into a contract with a licensed tradesperson, although each case is assessed individually.The couple say they will be more wary in the future, but think more education is needed. (ABC News: Nickoles Coleman)As for Ms James and Mr Jones, they're planning on being a lot more wary in the future and will only use tradespeople who've been recommended by their family and friends.

(Supplied)In short: The trial of a man accused of murdering his father and leaving him dead in his backyard for up to two days has begun in the Supreme Court in Wollongong.Milenko Snjegota, 49, also known as Gobesan, has pleaded not guilty to murdering his father, 74-year-old Vitomir Snjegota, at their Farmborough Heights home in February 2024. What's next? The judge-only trial is expected to run for two weeks. abc.net.au/news/snjegota-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-father/105528610Link copiedShareShare articleAn Illawarra man fatally struck his father over the head, leaving him for dead in the family backyard for up to two days, a Supreme Court trial has heard. Milenko Snjegota, 49, also known as Gobesan, has pleaded not guilty to murdering his 74-year-old father, Vitomir Snjegota, at their Farmborough Heights home west of Wollongong in February last year. Mr G Snjegota, who lives with diagnosed schizophrenia, wore earbuds as Justice Stephen Campbell opened the judge-only Supreme Court trial in Wollongong on Monday.Crown prosecutor Nerissa Keay told the court the victim was a divorced father of two, retired steel worker and Foxtel cable installer who lived in the downstairs portion of a two-storey home he built 50 years ago. The father and son lived at this home in Farmborough Heights. (ABC Illawarra: Tim Fernandez)Ms Keay said the accused had lived upstairs in the same property since his mental health began deteriorating in the late 1990s and was known to be rude to his father . He expressed hostility about being forced to receive mental health treatment, Ms Keay told the court. 'Struck over the head'The court heard Mr V Snjegota was found face down in his backyard covered in a white sheet, with significant blunt-force trauma to his head.Ms Keay said it was the Crown's case that Mr V Snjegota's son struck him over the head at least seven times with an object like a crowbar or hammer . It's the Crown case the accused killed Mr [V] Snjegota while mowing [the lawn] on February 3, and that the violence was more than necessary to kill him, Ms Keay told the court. The victim may have been dead 16 to 48 hours before being taken to the mortuary. The court heard Mr G Snjegota was due to receive an injection for his mental condition the day after his father's body was found. The court heard the victim emigrated from the former Yugoslavia to Australia at 17, married and had two children. (Supplied)Ms Keay told the court the victim's neighbour made the grim discovery on February 4 after noticing waterlogging and leakage from the property. The Crown will allege the accused tried to clean the scene with water, Ms Keay said.The court was also shown police body-worn camera vision and photos of brown leather shoes owned by the accused, which Ms Keay said contained traces of the victim's blood. DNA of the accused was also found on the white sheet covering the victim's body, she told the court. Milenko Snjegota is accused of murdering his father who was found dead in their Wollongong backyard. (ABC Illawarra: Tim Fernandez)However, the court heard no DNA evidence was found on two crowbars located in the family garage. Part of the Crown's case is the crowbars were cleaned with bleach found at the property, Ms Keay said.Defence says evidence circumstantial In his brief opening, defence lawyer Scott Fraser told the court there was only circumstantial evidence linking his client to the alleged murder.Forensic officers examined the scene for evidence earlier in the week. (ABC Illawarra: Tim Fernandez)He said the defence agreed with forensic information provided by the Crown and that the cause of death is not an issue .In regards to the crowbars being cleaned with bleach, Mr Fraser said cleaning had been a significant matter in his client's life, not just in this circumstance .The court heard the accused believed he had been misdiagnosed with schizophrenia and that the judge may have to consider the Cognitive Impairment Provisions Act in this case. Family 'emotionally abused'As the Crown's first witness, the victim's daughter Silvana Gnjegota held back tears as she detailed her brother's long history of mental decline.Silvana Snjegota told the court she spoke to her father on the phone about three days before his death. (Supplied)She told the court during cross-examination, in the years before the alleged murder, Mr G Snjegota was emotionally abusive to her and sent her threatening emails because he disagreed with the methods used to treat his condition. Neighbour Stephen Peck later gave evidence and said the accused would speak to Jesus … play music from his parked car every day … and was always pretty nasty to his father, which is a shame .The trial is expected to run for two weeks.

Robert James Angus. (Facebook: Barry Maney Group)Mr Stevens's 18-year-old son Charlie was hit by a car in Goolwa on the night of November 17, 2023, and died at 7pm the next day in Adelaide.The court heard Angus, a married father of four, sent the email later that night after hearing of Charlie's death in the media. Although comprised of only three words, the defendant's email was an expression of enjoyment and derision towards the commissioner's grief at the loss of his son, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) said in its submission to the court ahead of sentencing.Commissioner deeply offendedMagistrate Koula Kossiavelos said the DPP alleged Angus knew the deliberate timing of this offending would inflict maximum distress . It is submitted that the hypothetical reasonable person would be shocked, outraged and disgusted at your behaviour, she said. More importantly, this is what the commissioner has said in relation to being subjected to your email: he found the offending to be abhorrent, deeply offensive and cruel. In your record of interview, you showed no remorse or understanding of the gravity of your actions to the extent that you queried why police were bothering to investigate it. When asked why you sent the email, you responded, 'Because you could.' The man who hit and killed Charlie left the scene but was arrested that night. (ABC News)The court heard that since his offending, Angus had apologised in a letter to the commissioner and had been diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder and impulsive aggressive disorder.Magistrate Kossiavelos said the conditions contributed to the offending, but were not the cause of it. I find that his moral culpability for the offence is partially reduced, but there is a need for general and personal deterrence, she said.The court heard Angus did not remember sending the email and had not explained why he sent it.Offending 'at higher end'The court heard Angus was undergoing cognitive behaviour therapy and taking medication to stabilise his moods.The truck sales manager's last criminal conviction was in 2008.The maximum penalty for the crime is 12 months in jail and an $18,780 fine if convicted in a magistrate's court.Angus's lawyer pushed for no conviction to be recorded and for her client to be given a good behaviour bond.The Mount Gambier Magistrates Court heard Angus had mental health conditions. (ABC South East SA: Bec Whetham)Magistrate Kossiavelos ordered Angus to do 150 hours of community service within 12 months and to pay prosecution costs of $512. Reasonable persons would all find that what you did on November 18, 2023, was very offensive, she said.

(ABC News) We are a group of men organised into crews — we call ourselves 'the ones who block the roads', one of the men, Mohammad Salman, told the ABC. If you want to get aid and secure food, you have to come through here; otherwise you won't eat. Today, all these people have become gangsters. They seize food from trucks and anything they find on the road. They'll take food away from anyone. If someone grabs food from a truck and I don't get my share, I'll go after him. That's how we have become. If someone gets something, I will take it from him to eat. Some people here die from stabbings and attacks — all over food. We've all turned into mafias and road blockers. Some of the men say they have worked with a gang leader named Yasser Abu Shabab.Some of the gangs looting aid have reportedly been armed and protected by Israeli authorities. (ABC News)'Uncharismatic, illiterate' gang leaderOnce a wanted criminal, it's now widely believed that Abu Shabab has been armed and protected by the Israeli government — to take control of the part of southern Gaza where his family holds sway.Abu Shabab is apparently an unlikely figure to lead a resistance against Hamas's rule in Gaza, Gazan analyst Muhammad Shehada, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in The New Arab. Police in Gaza were perplexed when he emerged as a top gang leader. The security source told The New Arab that Abu Shabab is 35 years old, thin, weak, short [around 150 centimetres tall], uncharismatic, illiterate, has strabismus in one eye, and has never received military training, he said. To them, he didn't seem like someone with the leadership skills necessary to form a group of 300 armed militants, steal truckloads of aid, and store it under the radar. The UN says Yasser Abu Shabab's gang has been raiding aid trucks with the apparent indifference or protection of the Israeli military. (Supplied: Facebook)Israeli media have reported Abu Shabab escaped from jail with Israeli assistance early in the war. He was in a Hamas prison until October 2023 for theft and drug offences, and his release came under the cover of an Israeli attack on security facilities in the Strip at the beginning of the war. From that moment on, his name emerged as someone who would fill the security vacuum in eastern Rafah, the Israeli newspaper Maariv wrote.The United Nations has identified Abu Shabab's gang as one of those raiding aid convoys when they entered Gaza, saying they were doing so with the apparent protection or indifference of the Israeli military.Former French diplomat Jean-Pierre Filliu, who spent one month in Gaza with Doctors Without Borders from December 2024 to January 2025, said he witnessed the gang being protected by the IDF while looting trucks. The Israeli military recognised its inability to promote a clan-based alternative to Hamas and decided to rely more or less openly on organised crime, he wrote in Le Monde. The key figure in this manoeuvre was a previously minor member of a Rafah family, Yasser Abu Shabab, whom Hamas had imprisoned in the past for his various trafficking activities. But Israeli protection allowed Abu Shabab to substantially expand its activities and poach, from other clans, some 100 loyalists ready for anything, often ex-convicts. What could only be called a gang operated under the eyes of the Israeli army … and it was equipped with brand-new weapons, an irrefutable indication of its collaboration with the occupiers. The Netzarim Corridor, where many of the aid gangs lurk, separates northern Gaza from the south and was cleared of buildings by the Israeli military. (Supplied via Reuters: Planet Labs Inc)Gangs taking whatever they canA gang member confirmed to the ABC that Abu Shabab's group had been stealing and selling aid. People would work normally with Yasser just like employees. He had two shifts. It was easy, the gang member said. We used to stand by the roadside to wait for trucks from Gaza to Kerem Shalom. I would take whatever I could — flour, sugar, anything we needed. The man explained that much of the looted food was then sold to merchants, although he insisted aid groups were given some of it. They would unload the goods, and traders would come to buy them. Half of the supplies were distributed to institutions like schools, he said. The aid agency would arrive to collect its share and then distribute it to schools. Abu Shabab's gang call themselves the Anti-Terror Service or the Popular Forces . (ABC News)The gang member alleged Hamas had previously been stealing some aid, something the group denies. He [Yasser] was working in security when he saw the government and Hamas members stealing from the aid trucks as they passed through central Gaza and Nuseirat, he told the ABC. That's when he decided to take action — stealing the trucks to distribute some of the aid himself, handing out money, flour … and that was it. Abu Shabab and his men, now calling themselves the Anti-Terror Service or the Popular Forces , have been accused by many Gazans of working with the Israeli government.The Israeli government has said openly it has backed groups like the one Abu Shabab runs.Hamas fighters have clashed with members of Abu Shabab's gang. (ABC News)Netanyahu arms 'clans' in GazaIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted in June that his government had activated clans in Gaza opposed to Hamas.That sparked concerns from the opposition that their weapons could eventually be turned on the IDF, or used to create unmanageable chaos. In consultation with security officials, we made use of clans in Gaza that are opposed to Hamas, he said in a video on social media. What's wrong with that? It saves the lives of IDF soldiers. The Times of Israel said Defence officials had confirmed Mr Netanyahu was referring to the Abu Shabab gang. The sources confirmed that Israel has been arming the gang with Kalashnikov rifles, including some that were seized from Hamas during the ongoing war, it wrote on June 5.Palestinians guard trucks carrying aid into the north of Gaza from the Israeli-controlled Zikim crossing. (AFP: Bashar Taleb)Former Israeli defence minister Avigdor Lieberman has alleged Abu Shabab had ties to the IS terrorist group. The Israeli government is giving weapons to a group of criminals and felons, identified with Islamic State, at the direction of the prime minister, he told Israeli public radio.The Abu Shabab group was alleged to be providing security for the new, Israeli and US-backed food distribution operation, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.It denied any links with the gang. GHF has no association with Yasser or the 'Anti-Terror Service', it said in a statement sent to the ABC.Grave concerns over Gaza aid planPhoto shows A boy holds up a jar on the back of a truckAs Gazans approach starvation, Israel's government has stopped the United Nations and other agencies from distributing food in Gaza and replaced them with a mysterious new contractor.Hamas fighters have attacked the group, but said Israeli forces came to its defence, Israeli media reported. The arrival of the new aid operation has changed conditions in the south of Gaza, but Hamas is still keen to kill or imprison Abu Shabab again.On July 2, the Hamas-controlled Interior Ministry in Gaza gave Abu Shabab 10 days to surrender himself and face trial for treason.The ABC called and sent messages to Yasser Abu Shabab but did not receive a response.Comment has also been sought from the Israeli government and the IDF.Meanwhile, the Israeli government and military continue to dismiss United Nations reports of a worsening hunger crisis in Gaza.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is only distributing food parcels at limited locations in southern and central Gaza.Israel's government last month stopped allowing food shipments into the north.The men who block the roads are still waiting by the aid routes, hoping for any chance to seize supplies and stay alive.The UN says the hunger crisis in Gaza is worsening.

Miss, he said, after the woman — assuming it was a phone number from a love struck businessman — dropped the note unread into her purse. You’d better look at that note. I have a bomb. For good measure, he opened the briefcase to show her several red cylinders, connected by a wire.Cooper wanted $US200,000 ($305,910), an amount equal to $US1,591,781 ($2,434,697) in today's currency.He wanted it in a knapsack by 5pm. He also wanted two sets of parachutes — implying he intended to take a hostage.The plane would land at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and there the money would be brought aboard, Cooper told the flight crew.Then, and only then, would the 35 passengers be free to go.A leap from a plane launches a decades-long FBI manhuntUltimately the plane circled Seattle for two hours — during that time, many passengers later told media they didn’t even know what was going on.Richard Simmons, head of a prisoner-rehabilitation program, told reporters he slept most of the time we were up there . I saw one stewardess answer a call and her face dropped, he said. She looked bewildered and gulped. I guess she learned what was happening then. His wife, Barbara, worried they may have gotten on the wrong plane. First we went right past Seattle, then Everett, she said. All I could think of was the plane was going to Vancouver and we were on the wrong flight. On the ground, the FBI and the Seattle Police Department rushed to get the money, parachutes, and emergency personnel ready for the landing.The plane landed at 5.46pm, and the money was handed over by an airport staffer — 10,000 unmarked $20 bills in a cloth bag.The passengers got off. The flight attendants retrieved the parachutes. He told them he didn’t need the instructions on how to use them.The plane took off again a few hours later with only Cooper and the flight crew aboard, followed by three fighter jets.This time it was heading for Mexico City, but the hijacker would not make it that far.The black tie DB Cooper left behind on the plane he hijacked. (Supplied: FBI)As the plane travelled somewhere between Seattle and Reno around 8pm, Cooper ordered the flight attendants to open the staircase at the back of the plane.Then he tied the bag of money around his waist, donned his parachutes, and jumped.It was the end of the hijacking, but only the beginning of an investigation that would continue for decades.Suspects, interviews and a $30,000 hoax The new files released this month are the latest in a series to be declassified under the Trump administration.The first lot of more than 400 pages were published online in March.Bundles of crumbling $20 bills from DB Cooper's ransom money were unearthed by a small boy on a sandbar in the Columbia River in 1980. (Supplied: FBI)The documents, at times heavily redacted, outline leads and suspects pursued by the FBI over the years.At one point, a man in a wheelchair became their key suspect, only to be ruled out. It is believed that the hijacker in this case has full use of all of his extremities and witnesses did not tell of any physical disability, the agent wrote. A man confined to a wheel chair [sic] did not hijack the plane in this case. Other men investigated included former pilots and members of multiple different skydiving clubs who bore a resemblance to Cooper.Men who did not resemble the artist’s sketch but who had mentioned different ways to hijack an airplane or suggested the way to hijack [and] escape would be … using a parachute were also reported to police.Several documents include long and redacted lists of suspects whose photographs were shown to witnesses without success.A contributing editor for Newsweek magazine, Karl Fleming, told the FBI he had placed an ad in multiple newspapers asking DB Cooper to contact him.Heists that shocked the worldThe plane hijacking by DB Cooper is just one of a series of high-profile robberies which have hit the headlines around the world.The ad included his home phone number.He said he had been contacted and met multiple times with a man who identified himself as Cooper.At one point, he said he had been shown several $20 bills he said he was 98 per cent positive matched copies of the ransom money shown to him by an unknown source.He handed over $US30,000 ($45,810) for the exclusive interview, publishing a three-part series detailing Cooper’s side of the story.Two men were later convicted and sentenced to serve time in federal prison for impersonating Cooper and pocketing the money.The rest of the files do not draw any definitive conclusion.'DB Cooper, Where Are You?' In the years since the hijacking, the story has become part of American pop culture history.By 1972, T-shirts bearing the phrase DB Cooper, Where Are You? were already appearing in novelty shops across the west coast.A magazine cover featuring DB Cooper published in 1976, included in National Archives files. (National Archives)There have been dozens of fiction and non-fiction books about the case, as well as references in film and television.In David Lynch’s 1990 TV series Twin Peaks, the main character is named Dale Bartholomew Cooper — a nod to the now infamous hijacker.More recently, DB Cooper was revealed to be Loki in the Disney+ series Loki, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.An annual CooperCon convention is held in Seattle, letting Cooper enthusiasts and researchers swap theories.None of it has led to any answers.Max Shaffer, then chief of security for the Seattle region of the Federal Aviation Administration, told the New York Times in 1972 he believed Cooper was dead. I feel that one of these days some hunter in Oregon or Washington is going to find the skeleton of this man, he said.As of July 12, 2016, the FBI had officially ended their investigation, leaving it as one of the longest cold cases in the agency’s history. The mystery surrounding the hijacking of a Northwest Orient Airlines flight in 1971 by a still-unknown individual resulted in significant international attention and a decades-long manhunt, they said in a statement. Evidence obtained during the course of the investigation will now be preserved for historical purposes at FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC.

(Facebook)Their intelligence on Mr Ayik came after he was unwittingly recruited into spreading a police-bugged app, called AN0M, into the underworld by the AFP.The joint AFP and FBI operation involved planting the devices into the hands of criminals and watching on as they used it to organise murders, drug shipments and beatings in Australia and abroad.No AN0M cases against anyone charged in Australia have ever revealed what, if any, link they had to Mr Ayik, deepening the mystery of who one senior law enforcement source described as a Mr Big of the underworld .But a trove of court documents from the United States, released in recent months, reveal his alleged role in luring his mates into the police trap.The man behind the 'Oscar' monikerAs part of their investigation the AFP revealed how rival bikies and crime families would work together using AN0M to supply drugs all over Australia.In court documents from related AN0M cases in the United States, prosecutors described Mr Ayik as an influencer — a role that proved a profitable side hustle.In one filing referring to Mr Ayik under his AN0M username Oscar , one of his associates described how all the profits from the sale of 100 devices would go straight to him.Alleged Australian drug lord Hakan Ayik poses in a Facebook profile photo. (Facebook)That transaction would earn him $75,000 in Bitcoin, according to court documents.The same underling, the documents said, would go on to discuss in messages on the device how Mr Ayik and the crew could start a VIP service for certain AN0M customers.Others paint the picture of Mr Ayik as being the go-to person for AN0M, who would go on to sell more than 12,000 devices as well as allegedly leading the Comanchero from overseas.The Comanchero are one of the most powerful bikie gangs in Australia, who suffered a power struggle during Sydney's recent gangland war.What the AN0M device looked like, before it was revealed to be a police Trojan horse app. (Supplied: AFP)In another court document from the United States, an underling asks Mr Ayik: Touching base with you in relation to AN0M device we prepared for client Tiger? Another describes how Mr Ayik is alleged to have sent clients to those under him and how those clients paid cash through a family member of Mr Ayik.When news of the AN0M operation first broke, rumours from underworld and police sources purported Mr Ayik had fled for his safety to either Syria or Iraq.Two years later in 2023, 46-year-old Mr Ayik would be apprehended shirtless by Turkish police in a posh apartment belonging to him in the heart of Istanbul.Hakan Ayik, during his now infamous capture in Istanbul in 2023. (Reuters: Turkish Interior Ministry/Handout )Charges with a 262-year jail termMr Ayik lived a life of luxury while on the run in Türkiye, though the alleged drug kingpin will likely never face justice down under.Among the lavish hotels, cars and businesses in Istanbul, Mr Ayik was far from going to ground while wanted for a raft of serious drug offences across the globe.Vast swathes of his wealth have now been seized by Turkish authorities who are prosecuting him for a series of alleged drug crimes and money laundering offences.If convicted he faces 262 years in prison.Mr Ayik was rumoured to be a billion-dollar bikie while posting flashy social media snaps on the run and estimates of his wealth ranged from $250 million to as high as $1 billion.The former Sydney bikie is also wanted on a racketeering indictment in the US and appears on watch lists for police authorities from Europe to Australia.Hotels fit for a kingThe Kings Cross Hotel in Istanbul, owned by alleged Sydney crime boss Hakan Ayik.

(Supplied: Supreme Court of Western Australia)Instead, the pellets hit and killed Ralph Matthews Cox, who did not know Nguyen-Ha and had no involvement in the drug world.The jury deliberated for two days before finding Nguyen-Ha guilty of one charge of murder, as well as five counts of doing an act likely to endanger life.Final act in series of shootingsDuring his trial, Nguyen-Ha admitted firing the gun twice but claimed he replaced the shotgun shells with pellets filled with rock salt.He told the court it was his alleged accomplice, Matthew Gempton, who fired a third, fatal shot with a different gun.Gempton, a self-described debt collector, already received a reduced sentence for manslaughter over his role in the shooting after agreeing to be a key witness in Nguyen-Ha's trial.He admitted being Nguyen-Ha's driver in the shooting but said it was his accomplice who fired the gun.Police found Ralph Matthews Cox critically injured at a house in Landsdale in January 2022. (ABC News)The intended target of the shooting, Anthony Prior, admitted in court he had bashed Nguyen-Ha and stolen tens of thousands of dollars from him in late 2021, in a set-up which involved fake drugs.That triggered two earlier shootings at homes in Perth's northern suburbs in which Nguyen-Ha, along with Gempton, were targeting Prior.The prosecution maintained that in those shootings Nguyen-Ha was not a mere bystander but was a planner, and that he was indeed the lone gunman in the final Landsdale shooting.On that night, Mr Cox and his partner were asleep in their front bedroom and stirred when they heard someone outside.He said I've been hit , when he was shot, the court heard.Nguyen-Ha will face a sentencing hearing on August 22.

He wasn't anticipating that that man was going to come out the window and run like he did, he said. They've taken evasive action pretty quickly, and obviously we have seen the collision. It certainly wasn't a deliberate course of action as a way to arrest our offender. He said it was not yet clear how many cars were damaged during the pursuit. It wasn't a pursuit for the entirety of what was going on … there were periods were it just being followed by the air wing. There were some computers in the car that were being tracked, he said.

(ABC News: Che Chorley)In short:A teenager has been sentenced for his role in the ambush attacks on three men who were enticed to meetings via social media under the guise of sexual encounters.The 17-year-old did not orchestrate the meetings, but participated and did not attempt to stop it.What's next? The teenager was spared convictions but ordered to participate in family conferencing and placed on a six-month good behaviour bond.abc.net.au/news/teen-sentenced-for-vigilante-ambush-attacks/105511878Link copiedShareShare articleA teenager involved in vigilante attacks on men lured to meet-ups via social media under the guise of sexual encounters, has been spared convictions for his crimes.The now 18-year-old, was sentenced in Adelaide's Youth Court this week for his involvement in two separate ambushes instigated by his lifelong friend .In sentencing, Magistrate Tracee Micallef said the teen's friend had pretended to be an underage girl on social media and had sexualised conversations with a man aged in his 30s, before luring him to meet in person. The victim thought he was meeting to engage in a sexual interaction with what he thought was a young girl, she said.Ms Micallef said the teenager, who was 17 at the time, only became involved in the offending when his friend invited him to the planned meeting with the man in February. The [friend] came to you and said he had organised to meet up with a paedophile, Ms Micallef said. You agreed to go with him without making any further inquiries as to what was planned or what was happening … you clearly knew that a confrontation was likely to occur. 'Humiliating and degrading' act filmedDuring the confrontation, which involved a group of youths, the man was threatened with a machete and blocked from leaving.Ms Micallef said the man was forced to transfer money to one of the other youths' accounts, and told to remove his shirt and kiss the shoes of the group or he would be assaulted.The man initially refused and was punched. As he was in fear, he did what was asked of him and it was filmed — that is the humiliating and degrading act, Ms Micallef said.She said the victim fled and later tried to have the money returned via his bank but stopped the investigation when he received threats that the footage and embarrassing messages would be released to his family and workplace.Ms Micallef said the victim would always have a concern that the video footage of him is still out there in the cloud somewhere .She said the teen had agreed he was equally responsible for the offending despite not being the instigator or the planner .The teenager had pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated robbery, blackmail and engaging in humiliating or degrading filming in relation to that incident, along with aggravated robbery and attempted aggravated robbery in relation to a second incident in April this year.The men were lured to meet with the youths via social media. (AP: Jenny Kane)Ms Micallef said the second incident involved ambushing two men who were lured to a public area, for what they thought would be a sexual experiment, or interaction, with a third male .She said the two men saw someone in the dark , and were asked, but refused, to go back to their house or a school before they were threatened with a machete.A group of youths, including the now-18-year-old, assaulted the men — one of whom was put in a headlock — and tried to take their keys and wallets, but the men escaped and alerted the police.Ms Micallef said the teen was again not involved in the set-up, nor wielding the machete or making threats but was willingly present.She said the teen — who had spent about two weeks in youth detention after his arrest — had a stable home life, was well-behaved at school and had provided multiple glowing character references to the court.The magistrate said the teen had recognised that despite being long-time friends, the youth who organised the meetings was now a negative influence on your behaviour .'Vigilante behaviour is not acceptable'She said the court had been told that aside from his close friend, he did not know the other youths involved and had been dragged into the offending. Whilst I can accept that the first time you joined your childhood friend you may have not been aware of the planned robbery or humiliation or blackmail … but you did participate in it, she said. You did not leave, nor did you try to stop it. Even if you did nothing but stand there, by your presence you made it frightening for the victim and supported the others in that action. I can also accept that to some extent you may have thought that you were dealing with, or somehow punishing someone who was behaving inappropriately, or about to. However, this behaviour cannot be condoned in any way … this type of vigilante behaviour is not acceptable. Ms Micallef diverted the youth to family conferencing for the offences against the first victim and imposed a six-month good behaviour bond for the second incident. She did not impose any convictions.Posted Thu 10 Jul 2025 at 8:05pmThursday 10 Jul 2025 at 8:05pmThu 10 Jul 2025 at 8:05pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesTrump gives Putin an ultimatum after deal to rush weapons to UkraineTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Mark Rutte and Donald Trump in conversation while seated in the Oval Office.Albanese's two meetings with Xi 'a clear sign of goodwill' to China's elitesTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Anthony Albanese Xi Jinping compositeSupport payment for renters on Treasury's housing options listTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows housing minister Clare O'Neil speaking at press conference with Prime Minister anthony albaneseWho's a dole bludger now?

The prosecutor alleges the three acted in agreement, motivated by revenge against the teenager.What's next? The judge has told the jury they must reach a unanimous verdict for each accused who faces three charges. abc.net.au/news/charlie-gander-supreme-court-murder-trial-jury-deliberates/105517906Link copiedShareShare articleA jury has begun deliberating in the trial of three people accused of kidnapping, murdering and burning the body of a 19-year-old in northern Victoria in December 2022. The remains of Charlie Gander's body were found in a burnt-out car at Bunbartha on Christmas Eve, 2022.Kylie Stott, Dimitri D'Elio and Danny Clarke have pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, murder and arson in a trial painted by the prosecution as a desire for revenge against Charlie for ratting out their associate to the police.The jury was shown photos taken by Victoria Police of the burnt car, which contained the remains of Charlie Gander's body. (Supplied: Supreme Court of Victoria)At the time of the alleged offending, Ms Stott was aged 37, Mr D'Elio 24 and Mr Clarke 38.All three have pleaded not guilty.The 12 jurors have begun deliberating after 30 days of hearings, including about 41 witnesses made up of pathologists, DNA experts, emergency services and police officers. The jury also heard statements read out by the prosecutor from Mr Gander's girlfriend and his father Richard Gander, including final texts between the pair. Police evidence cost teenager 'dearly', says CrownIn his final address, Mr Gibson argued that each of the accused was guilty of the three charges because each of them was part of an agreement, arrangement or understanding with the others to kidnap Charlie Gander, to murder Charlie Gander and to burn the Ford Territory with Charlie Gander's body in it .Mr Gibson told the jury the alleged motive was Mr Gander's cooperation with police investigating a firearms breach by Tyson May, who was a good friend of Ms Stott. Mr Gander was also friends with Mr May and would hang out with him, the court heard.Following a police raid in Shepparton in November 2022, Mr Gander gave a police interview and made a witness statement about Mr May possessing a firearm. The court heard Gander's body contained high levels of ice, which could not be ruled out as a cause of death. (Supplied: Gander family)Mr May was under a firearms prohibition order, Mr Gibson said. A disc with the record of Mr Gander's police interview found its way into the hands of others , Mr Gibson said. It cost him dearly, he said.The court heard a kitchen knife wrapped in a bloodstained tea towel from under a car seat had a mixed DNA profile of four people, including Mr Gander. Forensic pathologist Paul Bedford, who conducted Mr Gander's autopsy, previously told the court extensive fire damage to the body meant the cause of death could not be ascertained.He also told the court toxicology reports had found very high levels of the drug methylamphetamine, commonly known as ice, which may have contributed to Mr Gander's death.Defence arguments Justice Michael Croucher presented a summary of the defence counsel's arguments to the court before the jury began deliberating.Daniel Sala, acting for Ms Stott, has rejected the prosecution's arguments that she was key in orchestrating the acts against Mr Gander and urged the jury to find her not guilty of murder or arson. Paul Kounnas, acting on behalf of Mr D'Elio, has argued Ms Stott and Mr Clarke were the prime movers in the alleged crimes and that Mr D'Elio was dragged along and used as a patsy . Emergency services found the car on fire on a dirt road in Bunbartha in Victoria's north. (Supplied: Supreme Court of Victoria)The court heard Mr D'Elio, who was in a relationship with Ms Stott, did not know Mr Gander or Mr Clarke and had no skin in the game .Christopher Terry, acting on behalf of Mr Clarke, has argued his client did not intend to kill Mr Gander or enter into any agreement to do so. He said there was no evidence of Mr Clarke's hatred towards Mr Gander or proof of an agreement, and that his client had been dragged into a terrible crime .Charges heard togetherJustice Croucher instructed the jury that they must reach a unanimous verdict for each of the accused, who each face three charges. The jury heard they may find the accused guilty of manslaughter as an alternative if they are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the higher charge of murder. Justice Croucher told the jury manslaughter did not require an intent to kill, but there must be an intentional assault that was dangerous and posed serious injury. He also told the jury their task did not include making moral judgements.He noted jurors had been tasked with not one trial but 12 separate decisions, with the three accused facing three charges and the potential for manslaughter. The 12 charges are being heard together for convenience, and the jury must not allow this fact to usurp justice and must consider each charge separately, Justice Croucher said.Posted Thu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:39amThursday 10 Jul 2025 at 9:39amThu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:39am, updated Thu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:41amThursday 10 Jul 2025 at 9:41amThu 10 Jul 2025 at 9:41amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesTrump gives Putin an ultimatum after deal to rush weapons to UkraineTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Mark Rutte and Donald Trump in conversation while seated in the Oval Office.Albanese's two meetings with Xi 'a clear sign of goodwill' to China's elitesTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Anthony Albanese Xi Jinping compositeSupport payment for renters on Treasury's housing options listTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows housing minister Clare O'Neil speaking at press conference with Prime Minister anthony albaneseWho's a dole bludger now?

His family held a candlelight vigil for him on June 30 in Homewood, Ala.Kim Chandler / APJuly 15, 2025, 6:30 PM EDTBy Deon J. HamptonAn independent autopsy determined that no exit wound or bullet was found in the body of an 18-year-old Black college freshman who was fatally shot by a police officer in Alabama, his family's attorney said Tuesday.Civil rights lawyer Ben Crump asked state officials and the Homewood Police Department to release body camera video of the deadly June 23 encounter to help explain why Jabari Peoples, an aspiring police detective with no criminal history, was killed, Crump said in a news conference.The Homewood Police Department said the video had been turned over to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, which is investigating the case. The police department has not released the name of the officer who shot Peoples.Crump said Peoples was majoring in computer information systems and criminal justice but did not name the school he attended. “Jabari represented the very best of what we had to offer and was doing everything right,” Crump said.The department said in a statement released two days after the shooting that the officer approached a vehicle parked in the back of a soccer complex around 9:30 that night because the officer smelled what seemed like marijuana.Recreational use of cannabis is illegal in Alabama but medical marijuana is legal.Vivian Sterling and William Peoples during a July 8 news conference in Homewood, Ala. Kim Chandler / APThe officer ordered Peoples and his girlfriend out of the vehicle, the statement said. The girlfriend's name has not been released by the department nor by Crump. When the officer attempted to arrest Peoples for unlawful possession of a controlled substance, the statement said, a physical struggle broke out between them. The officer was knocked to the ground, and Peoples grabbed a handgun from inside the driver’s-side door pocket, according to the statement.“The officer gave multiple verbal commands for Mr. Peoples to let go of the handgun,” department officials said in the statement.But Peoples’ girlfriend told his family and Crump that Peoples was unarmed, according to NBC News affiliate WVTM13 in Birmingham, Alabama.She told his family that she and Peoples were approached by a man in an unmarked vehicle with no lights or sirens and without visible identification, and that they complied with orders, the station reported.“We buried our child on Saturday, just show us what happened to our child please,” said Peoples' father, William Peoples, at the news conference.The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said Tuesday that releasing the video, even to just family members, could hinder its investigation.“Due to the ongoing investigation, we do not have any additional details to share.”The agency's response was contrary to what the police department said in its statement. The details surrounding this incident are clearly captured on the officer’s body worn camera, of which ALEA took possession, it said. Arrangements are being made to coordinate viewing of the video by Mr. Peoples’ family. Crump said releasing the video is crucial to understanding why Peoples was shot in the back and what happened to the bullet.The family hired a medical examiner in Atlanta to conduct an independent autopsy on Peoples' body before Saturday's funeral, Crump said. Family members told WVTM13 that the police department did not contact them the night their son was killed and that the Jefferson County Coroner’s Office conducted an autopsy without their consent. They also have not received an official police report on the shooting, they told the station.Chief Deputy Coroner Bill Yates confirmed his office completed an autopsy on Peoples but said the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency asked it not to release any information about the case. During the news conference Tuesday, people in the crowd could be heard chanting, “Show the video.”“If the goal is transparency and justice, this is not hard logic, give us the evidence,” said Leroy Maxwell Jr., another attorney representing the family.

July 14, 2025, 4:13 PM EDT / Updated July 15, 2025, 2:07 PM EDTBy David K. Li and Lindsay GoodSheriff's deputies arrested an alleged prankster on Monday and accused him of planting a creepy teddy bear that looked like it was made of bloody human tissue, officials said.Hector Corona Villanueva, 23, was booked on suspicion of causing a needless emergency response and planting phony evidence, according to a San Bernardino County Sheriff's statement.The macabre scene unfolded in the Mojave Desert city of Victorville, at a bus stop near a gas station on Bear Valley Road — about 85 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles and 150 miles southwest of the Nevada state line, officials said.A doll that was possibly made of human skin was found a little bit after noon on Sunday, according to a coroner's statement.A deputy coroner investigator determined this doll was made of a fabricated material and was not of human origin before a forensic pathologist also confirmed that the object was not human and contained no human tissue, the statement said. Our investigation found these dolls being sold on a website with the claim that the dolls are 'made of human skin,'” the coroner said.The suspect, who lives in Victorville, took up precious first responder time, officials said.“Incidents such as this take up valuable emergency resources and put the public at risk, possibly delaying response time to legitimate calls for service,” according to the sheriff’s department.A South Carolina artist identified the scary toy as one of his creations. Robert Kelly of Dark Seed Creations said he made that bear and confirmed to NBC News on Tuesday that he sold it via the e-commerce platform Etsy to Villanueva in Victorville.The creepy teddy bear was reported to authorities by both a customer and employee of the gas station, a sheriff's spokesperson said. The buyer, Villanueva, did not call in his own alleged prank, officials said. Kelly has made dozens of these teddy bears over two decades. And when pictures of the Victorville teddy bear started circulating on Sunday, Kelly said he knew instantly that it was one of his creations. I made the order, put in a box, sent it out and according to tracking, it was delivered (to Victorville) on the 12th, Kelly told NBC News. And then on the 13th, last night, I started getting all kinds of messages. Kelly, a longtime fan of Hellraiser director Clive Barker, said his products are made of latex and he has tinkered with various dyes to replicate the appearance of human skin. We've put skin on everything from guitars and teddy bears to couches, said Kelly, whose primary clients are haunted attractions, novelty stores and his Etsy store. We use latex live castings. So we take live castings of actual human models, which adds to the reality of the item. David K.

Judkins, 21, was arrested at the Four Seasons Hotel, 525 N Fort Lauderdale Beach Blvd, per a police report.The victim told investigators she waited to report the incident because “she felt bad due to [Judkins’] recent success and career” but changed her mind after speaking with her loved ones. Judkins and his ex-girlfriend had split in December but were rekindling their relationship at the time of the incident, the report shows.READ MORE: Cleveland Browns rookie cuffed after domestic violence incident in Broward: copsJudkins, who faces a misdemeanor domestic battery charge, bonded out of the Broward Main Jail on Sunday. The Miami Herald reached out to his attorney David Weinstein but hasn’t received a response as of Monday afternoon.Judkins’ ex-girlfriend told investigators that their spat began at the baggage claim of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, when Judkins got frustrated after reading messages from family members. The nature of the messages wasn’t mention in the police report.However, their argument escalated when they entered a Lamborghini SUV. Judkins’ ex, according to the report, told him the messages weren’t true, then Judkins punched her in the mouth.Officers noted in the report that she had visible bruising on her chin — and photographs of her injuries.At one point, the victim got out of the SUV and called Judkins’ mother, although she didn’t tell her what had transpired, the report says. She got back inside, and the squabble over the messages continued. Judkins then hit his ex-girlfriend several times while driving, according to the report. She had visible bruises on her arm and thigh — and photos of her injuries, officers noted.She told police she began to kick her feet at Judkins to defend herself, the report says. Shortly after, Judkins pulled into a Burger King parking lot, where his ex told him, “Don’t touch me again.”It’s unclear from the police report what happened in the five days before she reported the incident.Judkins was selected in the second round with the 36th overall pick in the 2025 NFL draft by the Browns after having played for the Ohio State Buckeyes. In 2022, he was named SEC Freshman of the Year when he was a second-string running back for the University of Mississippi Rebels.

Miami Police are not saying what they’re doing to bring him back. Jason Getz Jason Getz-USA TODAY Sports A month after being charged with attempted murder, former NFL star Antonio Brown has posted videos on social media flaunting his lavish lifestyle abroad — riding around in expensive cars and sauntering on a yacht overlooking Dubai’s skyscrapers.It’s almost as if Brown, 37, were taunting police. But Miami Police will not say whether they consider Brown on the run — or if they’re working to bring him back to the U.S. to face trial.A Miami-Dade judge signed off on Brown’s arrest warrant a month ago. But police don’t appear to be looking for him and refuse to discuss the case. There’s also no record or court date for Brown in the database of Miami-Dade circuit court records.READ MORE: Antonio Brown charged with attempted murder after shooting at Miami boxing eventIn a video uploaded to X on Thursday, Brown is seen celebrating his birthday in a red Ferrari 812 GTS and hanging out with his young sons on the water.

The jewelry designer spent a month in jail in the United Arab Emirates, documents show, before proving that Brown lied.READ MORE: Antonio Brown’s false accusations put Miami jeweler in Dubai jail for month: lawsuitPeople accused of crimes usually negotiate with authorities to surrender upon their return. Brown had an attorney early on who secured him a $10,000 bond, including house arrest. As of Thursday, it’s unclear if Brown was being represented by an attorney. Another unknown: whether prosecutors will continue to honor the bond agreement in place. Brown could be detained by the FBI or U.S. Marshals if Miami Police or the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office request that the federal agencies issue a warrant for Brown’s return, said Jeffrey Sloman, a Miami criminal defense attorney who served briefly as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. This is usually accomplished through a federal charge brought forward if a person is avoiding prosecution. If a person remains a fugitive, they may not be granted bond to get out of jail, or a judge could be more harsh in their confinement, Sloman said. The attorney said to look no further than his client Ohad Fisherman, who was on his honeymoon in Japan but returned quickly to address the criminal charge against him. Fisherman — who was entangled in one of the cases brought by the state against the Alexander brothers — had a sex crime charge against him dropped on Monday by state prosecutors.READ MORE: Alexander brothers’ friend cleared in sex case — tearful, angry at state prosecutors“It’s in [Brown’s] best interest to come back immediately, so hopefully the judge would give him a reasonable bond so he can fight the charges out of jail,” Sloman said. “It’s very difficult to fight a case in jail. If Mr. Brown continues to avoid prosecution, eventually he will travel somewhere or to some place and he will be arrested.”Padilla told the Herald police likely believe that Brown will return to South Florida because he has property and children in the area. Formally extraditing Brown, he said, would be costly.

Daniel A. Varela dvarela@miamiherald.com “It’s not easy for the FBI to be dragging people from the Middle East,” Padilla said. “There’ll be a point that if this continues, it could manifest into something larger.”Brown should contact an attorney to turn himself in, Padilla said, because a judge could factor in the amount of time he was abroad after the warrant was signed when deciding his bond. “This is a serious crime. This isn’t going to go away,” Padilla said. “...He’s going to have to face these charges.” Grethel Aguila Miami Herald Go to X Email this person Grethel covers courts and the criminal justice system for the Miami Herald.

He was the father of two children. The driver was arrested Tuesday, July 8, 2025. GoFundMe Andres Roberto Fiallos Estupiñan, accused of running down and killing a father who was jogging in his Shenandoah neighborhood, was booked into jail Tuesday after he was released from Jackson Memorial Hospital, where police had to Taser him to subdue him, his attorney said.Fiallos Estupiñan had been hospitalized since June 10 after suffering a broken ankle while fleeing the scene of the fatal hit-and-run at Southwest 21st Avenue and 18th Street. Residents tackled him near Shenandoah Park after they say he struck 50-year-old jogger Andrew Loretta with a Volkswagen Jetta, then careened into an ice cream truck and several other vehicles before attempting to run away.Jail records show that Fiallos Estupiñan, 36, was hit with multiple charges, including leaving the scene of the crash involving death, leaving the scene of a crash with serious bodily injury, reckless driving and vehicular homicide. READ MORE: Suspect in Miami hit-and-run unconscious for weeks after hospital clash with copsPsychotic episode caused the tragedy, attorney saysFiallos Estupiñan was hospitalized for weeks and listed in critical condition, leaving his family and attorney reeling with questions on how his condition deteriorated when he went in for a broken ankle. His attorney, Bradley Horenstein, said Fiallos Estupiñan — who has a history of mental health issues — had a psychotic episode that started before the crash.“This unimaginably tragic case is the result of Mr. Fiallos Estupiñan having suffered a psychotic break, which the hospital spent weeks successfully treating with medication,” Horenstein told the Miami Herald Wednesday.According to Horenstein, Fiallos Estupiñan became agitated while handcuffed to a hospital bed and attempted to get up and leave. A Miami police officer stationed at his bedside Tasered Fiallos Estupiñan multiple times to subdue him. When that had little effect, hospital staff gave him ketamine, an anesthetic used for surgery, and Estupinan was intubated for his safety. A psychiatric evaluation conducted at the hospital provided further detail on the severity of Fiallos Estupiñan’s condition. According to the five-page report, he ripped out his IV line, jumped out of bed naked while handcuffed and set off a hospital alarm after throwing himself against a wall vent.Horenstein said doctors continued to sedate him as he was not responding to medications for the psychosis. Further, Fiallos Estupiñan developed pneumonia and a bacterial infection in his lungs, which landed him in critical condition and the Intensive Care Unit. Andres Roberto Fiallo Estupinan, accused of the hit-and-run death of a Shenandoah father out for a jog on June 10, was jailed Tuesday, July 8, 2025. He’s facing a slew of charges. Estupinan family photo For three weeks, Horenstein was unable to speak to his client due to the heavy sedation.At one point, doctors performed a tracheotomy to avoid long-term damage to his vocal cords from prolonged intubation. Horenstein noted the situation was so dire that his client’s mother was granted a humanitarian visa to fly to the U.S. and sit by his bedside.“The hospital and the City of Miami Police Department were very accommodating,” Horenstein said.Fiallos Estupiñan was slowly weaned off the sedatives as the anti-psychotic medication began to take effect; he is now lucid and calm, Horenstein said.Set to be released on conditionsFiallos Estupiñan appeared in Miami-Dade Bond Court on Wednesday before Judge Gisela Cardonne Ely in an orange jumpsuit with a visible cast on his leg. At the hearing, prosecutors said Fiallos Estupiñan was driving 75 miles per hour in a 25-mph residential zone at the time of the crash. They argued he is both a danger to the community and a flight risk.Prosecutors requested Fiallos Estupiñan’s total bond be set at no less than $100,000 and that if released, he be placed on house arrest, be barred from driving and have his passport confiscated.Horenstein pushed back, telling the judge his client is not a danger to himself or others, but made no arguments on the $100,000 bond. He noted that Fiallos Estupiñan had been hospitalized for nearly a month after the crash and is a commercial engineer by profession. His mother and sister were present in the courtroom.The judge set bond at $25,000 for each charge, for a total of $100,000. She also ordered Fiallos Estupiñan to be placed on Level 2 house arrest, meaning he can only leave home for work, church or meetings with his lawyer.Fiallos Estupiñan, who was born in Ecuador and lived in Chile, was also ordered to surrender his passport before being released from jail. Horenstein said the passport was believed to be inside Estupinan’s car, which has been impounded as evidence by the Miami Police Department.Despite that, Judge Cardonne Ely said the passport must be turned over before Estupinan could walk out of jail. Prosecutors asked Horenstein to provide proof the passport was not in his client’s possession. The judge removed the passport confiscation condition after Horenstein said he confirmed with the Miami Police sergeant supervising the case that the passport was in their possession.Witnesses held him downAccording to his arrest affidavit, Fiallos Estupiñan was driving a gray 2012 Volkswagen Passat on June 10 at a “high rate of speed” southbound on Southwest 21st Avenue near 17th Street just before 7 p.m. Police say he had an expired Florida driver’s license.At the same time, Andrew Loretta, 50, was jogging along the west side of 21st Avenue, heading toward 18th Street.Surveillance footage shows Fiallos Estupiñan striking the jogger from behind with such force that Loretta was thrown into the air and both of his legs were severed.After hitting Loretta, Fiallos Estupiñan crashed into a white 2013 Nissan ice cream van that was stopped at 21st Avenue and 18th Street, serving children at Shenandoah Park. Police say Estupinan made no “visible attempt to brake” before the impact.The Volkswagen then struck two more parked vehicles: a gray 2019 Toyota and a white 2023 Mercedes SUV, both on the west side of 21st Avenue near the park.Two witnesses told police that Fiallos Estupiñan immediately got out of the car and ran away without trying to help the injured jogger or calling 911. He ran into Shenandoah Park, where several bystanders stopped him and held him down until officers arrived.Loretta was pronounced dead at the scene. Estupinan had a broken ankle, while a passenger in one of the hit cars had a skull fracture.A beloved community memberIn Miami’s Shenandoah neighborhood, just off Coral Way, the sudden death of Loretta—a married telecommunications executive and father of two teenagers—has left his family heartbroken and the community in shock. Friends and relatives described him as an avid jogger and soccer enthusiast who moved to Miami from California in 2000. He was fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.A GoFundMe page to support Andrew’s family has raised over $193,000 with just over 900 donations.“I hope that justice is served. Not only for Andy, but for the family ... At the end of the day [Andres] has to deal with his own karma. I honestly feel a lot of compassion for him. It’s just a terrible situation,” John Loretta, Andrew’s cousin, who lives in Kendall, said.The Loretta family, including his wife and children, said in a statement through their attorney that they are grateful for the support they have received.“This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the Loretta family, and they remain deeply grateful for the outpouring of support from family, friends, and the community,” Raul Chacon, the family’s attorney, said in a statement to the Miami Herald. “At this point, they will have no further comment on the ongoing legal proceedings. Thank you for respecting their privacy and understanding their need to grieve in peace. “Miami Herald writer Isabel Rivera contributed to this report.This story was originally published July 9, 2025 at 4:17 PM.

Suarez pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit bank and mail fraud, along with aggravated identity theft. He faces several years in prison, including mandatory-minimum punishment of two years for the ID theft conviction, at his sentencing hearing in September before U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams.Suarez was indicted in 2023 but was living in Panama City, Panama, at the time. In early 2025, he was arrested in Panama and brought to South Florida to face the charges. According to a factual statement filed with his plea agreement, here’s how Suarez carried out the scam during an FBI-led undercover operation:More than 80 fraudulent checksIn March 2022, Suarez told a confidential informant that he had access to the bank account of an elderly person, who was 82 years old at the time. Suarez created and mailed dozens of falsified checks from Panama to South Florida to the victim’s bank with directions to cash them and return half of the money to his account at Bank of America. The ill-gotten proceeds were wired to his Miami-based company, Online Electronics.To carry out the scheme, Suarez’s fraudulent checks contained forged signatures designed to resemble that of the victim’s on a signature card at Truist Bank.“In total, Suarez and his co-conspirators stole $803,146 from [the victim’s] bank account at Truist through the issuance of more than 80 fraudulent checks to numerous different payees, including at least five individuals and various companies,” according to the factual statement signed by the defendant, his lawyer and a prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami.The statement also said the elderly person reviewed the names of the individuals and companies involved in the fraudulent check transactions. The person did not authorize any of them.The case, investigated by the FBI, Secret Service and FDIC’s Office of Inspector General, was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Thor Pogozelski.This story was originally published July 10, 2025 at 11:32 AM.

Appeals judges have now reduced his sentence from 18 to 13 years.https://p.dw.com/p/4xSWKJudges at the Hague in the 2024 ruling said the torture perpetrated by Shala was of particular cruelty. Image: Piroschka van de Wouw/Pool/AP/picture alliance AdvertisementKosovo Liberation Army (KLA) member Pjeter Shala saw his conviction upheld but the sentence reduced from 18 to 13 years, the Kosovo Specialist Chambers tribunal in The Hague said on Monday. The tribunal, staffed by international judges and lawyers, was set up in 2015 to handle cases under Kosovo law against fighters of the KLA. The court said Shala's original sentencing was out of reasonable proportion to comparable cases. Shala was convicted in 2024 of war crimes during the during the 1998-99 Kosovo uprising against Serbian troops. He was found guilty of torture, murder and arbitrary detention, which he committed as he ran a makeshift prison where people considered to be spies or collaborators with Serbs were housed. What did appeals judges say? The original Hague tribunal conviction was appealed, with judges reversing several convictions for torture and arbitrary detention in relation to some victims, but confirming convictions for the same war crimes involving other victims. Judges also determined that the previous conviction had not taken into account that Shala was not in a commanding role for the murder charge. In the end, judges reduced his sentence from 18 to 13 years. The reduction in his sentence in no way suggests that the crimes for which he has been convicted and sentenced are not grave, judge Kai Ambos told the court. Shala exhibited 'particular cruelty' Shala followed the hearing by video link, dressed in a light blue shirt and tie. As the decision was read out, he shook his head and appeared to be speaking but his words were not broadcast. Victims under Shala were beaten with batons and baseball bats, forced to hit each other, burned with cigarettes, coerced to simulate sexual acts with each other, and in some cases shot. Judges at the earlier trial said the torture perpetrated by Shala was of particular cruelty and the victims were particularly vulnerable and defenseless. The victims were largely ethnic Albanians accused by the KLA of collaboration with Serbian forces. More than 13,000 people are believed to have died during the 1998-99 Kosovo uprising against Serbian troops, led by then-president Slobodan Milosevic.

Here's how the death cap became the center of a chilling murder case. https://p.dw.com/p/4x8P8Even small amounts of death cap mushrooms are lethal if consumed.Image: Hans Reinhard/Okapia/picture-allianceAdvertisementA jury in Australia has found Erin Patterson guilty on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder. The murder weapon: Toxic mushrooms. Prosecutors argued Patterson intentionally served four of her family members with meal portions containing toxic death cap mushrooms in 2023. Patterson denied being guilty, originally telling police she had used store-bought mushrooms from a supermarket, then an Asian grocer in Melbourne. A search of such stores found no evidence that poisonous mushrooms had ever been sold. During the trial, Patterson said she may have foraged for the mushrooms but could not say for certain where she had obtained the death caps. Why are death cap mushrooms so deadly? Deadly by name and by nature, death cap mushrooms (Amanita phalloides) are full of a highly stable toxin called alpha-Amanitin. The toxin is so stable that it won't break down when exposed to heat in cooking. When a death cap is eaten, people don’t usually feel symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea until at least 6 hours later. During this time the alpha-Amanitin toxins are making their way through the bloodstream into organs of the body. The toxin primarily acts in the liver, where it causes cells in the liver to die. Alpha-Amanitin binds with RNA polymerase-II enzymes, preventing the cells from creating new proteins. Eventually, the liver starts to shut down. Death can occur within 24 hours. Careful identification required The Amanita genus of fungi is well-known for their toxic properties. This group include the fairytale toadstool commonly known as the fly agaric, death caps, and destroying angels . But some other Amanita mushrooms are edible. Most cases of death cap poisoning are often a case of misidentification — their classic white appearance and domed cap looks like many other types of fungi. Identification of mushrooms requires a knowledge of different parts of the anatomy: the cap or fruiting body, the gills or spores beneath the cap, and the stipe — or stalk. While death caps look like many other mushrooms, one defining characteristic is their bad smell. They don't store well at all, unless you dehydrate them. They quickly go very stinky and very nasty, Brett Summerell, a fungi expert and Chief Scientist at the Botanic Gardens of Sydney, Australia, told DW. Because of the risk of misidentification by amateurs, it's usually recommended that foragers go for edible species that cannot be mistaken. Of course, foraging under the supervision of a trained mycologist — a fungi scientist — is usually a safe option. The famous red and white toadstool is a member of the Amanita genus, and a cousin of other deadly mushroom species.Image: FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP No death caps in the supermarket The jury ultimately didn’t find Patterson’s defense — that she mixed up foraged mushrooms in the same container as store-bought ones — believable. The prosecution argued Patterson knowingly put the toxic mushrooms in the home-cooked lunch and disposed of evidence. Summerell said the likelihood that death caps could get into store-bought products is, to be honest, farcical. The reason? Death caps only grow next to oak and beech trees. Death caps, like many fungi, are mycorrhizal, meaning they have a symbiotic relationship with the tree species. Death caps obtain their nutrients from nearby tree roots and return nutrients to the nearby soil. But because they can only grow at the base of oak and beech trees, it means there's no chance of them sprouting in a commercial setting, where spores are cultivated in highly controlled conditions — and with no trees in sight. Australia could get rid of death caps Death caps aren’t native to Australia, and neither are the oak and beech trees that support them. The trees were first introduced into Australia from Europe in the 19th ecntury, and death caps in the 1960s. Summerell and other mycologists are now discussing the possibility of removing oak trees in some parts of Australia. We have argued that, in Sydney, if it's at all possible, we should start to think about removing oak trees from some of these suburbs just from the point of view of a public health risk, said Summerell. Removing introduced oaks could harbor positive benefits, both from a public health perspective by removing the risk of the top cause of mushroom poisoning, as well as providing more space for native Australian plant life.

But some criminologists doubt the figures.https://p.dw.com/p/4wuVjShoplifting is on the rise, say retailersImage: Carsten Milbret/imageBROKER/picture allianceAdvertisementGermany has never had more shoplifters than in 2024. An annual survey of 98 retailers estimates a 3% increase on the year before — amounting to some €4.95 billion ($5.84 billion) in losses. The latest study by Germany's Retail Institute (EHI) on inventory differences shows that the vast majority of those losses (€4.2 billion) was down to theft from customers, employees, or delivery workers, the EHI said, which would mean losses of some €570 million to the public purse through lost sales tax. The EHI also said that retailers had to resort to balancing out their losses and the costs of extra security by increasing prices. Study author Frank Horst calculated that some 1.5% of prices in stores could now be attributed to covering theft and security. Shoplifting techniques The EHI said there had also been a 5% increase in organized shoplifting, which accounted for a third of the total shoplifting losses. Horst said this could be individual thieves working their way through a shopping list, or else, the thefts could be carried out by coordinated groups. One of them drives a vehicle, one of them distracts the staff, or shields the one putting the goods away so they can't be seen, Horst told DW. Sometimes so-called depots are set up in the store, where all the goods are packed in a bag, and then someone else carries it out in a surreptitious moment. The survey does not include exact breakdowns of the kinds of articles that get stolen, but Horst says that thieves often target anything small, expensive, and that can be easily re-sold, such as perfume and cosmetics. There had also been a rise in the theft of foods, especially relatively expensive things like meats and cheeses. But Nicole Bögelein, a criminologist at Cologne University, cast doubt on how useful the study actually is. She told DW that the researchers estimate that 98% of cases aren't even discovered. So it's just an assumption that the majority of these losses can be attributed to theft, she said. Bögelein also cast doubt on the EHI's conclusion that there are more organized shoplifting gangs, as that could simply be because store detectives are more on the lookout for such groups. 'Poverty crimes' Despite its shortcomings, the annual EHI survey is one of the few shoplifting studies there are, and it is focused mostly on the economic impact. Bögelein, by training a sociologist as well as a criminologist, has a different perspective and says that almost all cases of shoplifting are so-called poverty crimes — defined as crimes that don't cost any money to carry out, and are committed by people because they have no money. Bögelein's own investigations into shoplifting have found that the people who are caught are often poor — possibly, she says, also because store detectives are more likely to keep an eye on people who look poor. Official statistics suggest that the majority of thefts from shops are relatively petty. According to German federal police statistics, in 66.7% of discovered and prosecuted thefts, the value of the items stolen was under €50 and in 40.2% of cases even under €15. The punishment is usually a small fine, or, if the fine can't or won't be paid, a prison sentence. Germany a 'paradise' for shoplifters? Horst described Germany as a paradise for shoplifters, as the punishments are often relatively mild. Though theoretically thieves can be imprisoned for up to five years, he said that in practice first-time offenders are often not charged at all. Bögelein said that deterrence might have an effect on some minor thefts, but was generally skeptical of the idea that more punishment discourages petty crime. People don't not steal because they're scared of punishment, she argued. In criminology, we find that people stick to rules because they think those rules are correct and because they fear a bad conscience if they don't stick to them. Public transport operators in Germany often charge people a fee for riding without a ticket, but may also press charges, especially for repeat offenders.Image: picture-alliance/dpa/J. Wolf Should shoplifting be decriminalized in Germany? There has been a debate among German criminologists about to what extent poverty crimes should be decriminalized altogether, on the grounds that such crimes are usually victimless and therefore don't require criminal justice. There have long been calls to downgrade one classic poverty crime — riding public transport without a ticket — to a misdemeanor, partly because punishing it has become a burden to public coffers and is clogging up the justice system. Between 8,000 and 9,000 people end up in prison in Germany every year for riding without a ticket. But Horst argued that shoplifting shouldn't always be defined as a poverty crime: The EHI estimates that two-thirds of shoplifting cases were what he called opportunistic perpetrators, and many of them are not necessarily poor. Horst does think that inflation and higher prices for basic items may be playing a role in the rise of shoplifting, but he was reluctant to accept that poverty was the driving element of all theft. It could be a protest theft, because people are saying they're not prepared to accept the price rises for a particular product, he said, I'm sure poverty is a part of it, but that it explains the rise on its own — I don't see that.

But some criminologists doubt the figures.https://p.dw.com/p/4wuVjShoplifting is on the rise, say retailersImage: Carsten Milbret/imageBROKER/picture allianceAdvertisementGermany has never had more shoplifters than in 2024. An annual survey of 98 retailers estimates a 3% increase on the year before — amounting to some €4.95 billion ($5.84 billion) in losses. The latest study by Germany's Retail Institute (EHI) on inventory differences shows that the vast majority of those losses (€4.2 billion) was down to theft from customers, employees, or delivery workers, the EHI said, which would mean losses of some €570 million to the public purse through lost sales tax. The EHI also said that retailers had to resort to balancing out their losses and the costs of extra security by increasing prices. Study author Frank Horst calculated that some 1.5% of prices in stores could now be attributed to covering theft and security. Shoplifting techniques The EHI said there had also been a 5% increase in organized shoplifting, which accounted for a third of the total shoplifting losses. Horst said this could be individual thieves working their way through a shopping list, or else, the thefts could be carried out by coordinated groups. One of them drives a vehicle, one of them distracts the staff, or shields the one putting the goods away so they can't be seen, Horst told DW. Sometimes so-called depots are set up in the store, where all the goods are packed in a bag, and then someone else carries it out in a surreptitious moment. The survey does not include exact breakdowns of the kinds of articles that get stolen, but Horst says that thieves often target anything small, expensive, and that can be easily re-sold, such as perfume and cosmetics. There had also been a rise in the theft of foods, especially relatively expensive things like meats and cheeses. But Nicole Bögelein, a criminologist at Cologne University, cast doubt on how useful the study actually is. She told DW that the researchers estimate that 98% of cases aren't even discovered. So it's just an assumption that the majority of these losses can be attributed to theft, she said. Bögelein also cast doubt on the EHI's conclusion that there are more organized shoplifting gangs, as that could simply be because store detectives are more on the lookout for such groups. 'Poverty crimes' Despite its shortcomings, the annual EHI survey is one of the few shoplifting studies there are, and it is focused mostly on the economic impact. Bögelein, by training a sociologist as well as a criminologist, has a different perspective and says that almost all cases of shoplifting are so-called poverty crimes — defined as crimes that don't cost any money to carry out, and are committed by people because they have no money. Bögelein's own investigations into shoplifting have found that the people who are caught are often poor — possibly, she says, also because store detectives are more likely to keep an eye on people who look poor. Official statistics suggest that the majority of thefts from shops are relatively petty. According to German federal police statistics, in 66.7% of discovered and prosecuted thefts, the value of the items stolen was under €50 and in 40.2% of cases even under €15. The punishment is usually a small fine, or, if the fine can't or won't be paid, a prison sentence. Germany a 'paradise' for shoplifters? Horst described Germany as a paradise for shoplifters, as the punishments are often relatively mild. Though theoretically thieves can be imprisoned for up to five years, he said that in practice first-time offenders are often not charged at all. Bögelein said that deterrence might have an effect on some minor thefts, but was generally skeptical of the idea that more punishment discourages petty crime. People don't not steal because they're scared of punishment, she argued. In criminology, we find that people stick to rules because they think those rules are correct and because they fear a bad conscience if they don't stick to them. Public transport operators in Germany often charge people a fee for riding without a ticket, but may also press charges, especially for repeat offenders.Image: picture-alliance/dpa/J. Wolf Should shoplifting be decriminalized in Germany? There has been a debate among German criminologists about to what extent poverty crimes should be decriminalized altogether, on the grounds that such crimes are usually victimless and therefore don't require criminal justice. There have long been calls to downgrade one classic poverty crime — riding public transport without a ticket — to a misdemeanor, partly because punishing it has become a burden to public coffers and is clogging up the justice system. Between 8,000 and 9,000 people end up in prison in Germany every year for riding without a ticket. But Horst argued that shoplifting shouldn't always be defined as a poverty crime: The EHI estimates that two-thirds of shoplifting cases were what he called opportunistic perpetrators, and many of them are not necessarily poor.

It could be a protest theft, because people are saying they're not prepared to accept the price rises for a particular product, he said, I'm sure poverty is a part of it, but that it explains the rise on its own — I don't see that.

Why is there a market for her content in the Balkan country and how are some Bulgarians fighting it?https://p.dw.com/p/4vrvKOn her social media profiles, Bulgarian influencer Zornitsa Gyutsova posts misogynistic advice about how men should 'deal with' womenImage: Zgyutsova/TikTokAdvertisement Women love men who can be violent if need be. That's why they like men who hit them, Bulgarian influencer Zornitsa Gyutsova tells her followers. Gyutsova suggests that not only do women prefer men who physically assault them, but that this is also the way men should behave because a woman should respect a man's physical power since she is unable to comprehend his intellectual power. This is the kind of advice that can be found on Gyutsova's social media profiles and in a private group founded by her on Telegram called Upstanding Man. 'Equality is contrary to human nature' Zornitsa Gyutsova offers her followers private chats over video where she teaches them how to deal with women — for a fee, of course. Many influencers, life coaches and other online personalities in Bulgaria and elsewhere offer private sessions or courses. What makes Gyutsova's content stand out from the rest is that its sole purpose is to explain to men that they need to learn to control their partners both psychologically and, if necessary, physically.There have been numerous protests against violence against women in Bulgaria in recent years, such as this one in 2023Image: Alexandar Detev/DW In Gyutsova's view, men in general have been treated badly by women, and women are the ones who exert violence on men, namely by not paying them enough respect. The idea of equality is like a worm in people's brains that insists men and women should be partners […] which is so contrary to human nature that it can never work, Gyutsova declared in a long video about her work that was broadcast on Bulgarian National Television. Although the broadcaster, which is partly financed by taxpayer's money, has since removed the video from its platforms, it has never publicly commented on the case. Huge backlash Gyutsova's profiles on social media have been gaining traction for several years now. Screenshots and videos from her private Telegram group chat recently surfaced on social media, triggering a huge backlash in Bulgaria. Local woman Petya Krasteva was so appalled by Gyutsova's online content that she filed a complaint against Gyutsova with the prosecutor's office. On her social media channels, she not only encourages people to degrade women and use violence against them, she also boasts that she uses the same methods on her child and her cat, she told DW. I thought to myself: This is not only absolutely unacceptable, it's criminal. Gender discrimination not a crime in Bulgaria Many other women did the same as Krasteva, only to find out a couple of weeks later that their efforts had been in vain.Petya Krasteva was appalled by Zornitsa Gyutsova's online content and filed a complaint against her with the prosecutor's officeImage: Nikola Gyulmezov In an official reply, the prosecutor's office stated that nothing could be done because Bulgaria's criminal code does not define gender discrimination as a crime and that the issue was a matter for the Commission against Discrimination. Krasteva promptly lodged a complaint with this commission, but received another negative answer based on the same reasoning. Profiles briefly taken down Although these complaints did not lead to charges being brought against Gyutsova, the backlash did have an impact. The outcry and the fact that Gyutsova's social media accounts were reported by people who found their content abhorrent, meant that the influencer's TikTok and Instagram profiles were deactivated. They were, however, reactivated a short time later. Impunity for abusers Krasteva feels that part of the reason why content like Gyutsova's strikes a chord in Bulgaria is that while patriarchal norms and domestic violence are not accepted in the country, Bulgarian society often turns a blind eye to them. The other huge problem, she says, is that as with many other social issues, there is a complete lack of consequences for the perpetrators. Valentina Dimitrova, a psychologist who works for the Emprove Foundation, a Bulgarian organization that supports women who have suffered domestic violence, holds a similar view.Psychologist Valentina Dimitrova says that content like Gyutsova's is dangerous because 'it can truly cost a human life'Image: Venera Velkovska Sadly it's embedded in the Bulgarian mindset that we often just accept that things are bad and we do nothing about it, says Dimitrova. She believes that this is also why many women stay in violent relationships: They simply have no faith in the authorities because time and time again, men who beat or even kill their partners face no legal consequences. Although some people seem to think that social media content is less problematic than actual abuse in real life, Dimitrova stresses the dangers associated with such content: It can truly cost a human life. A global online problem Misogynistic online content that paints women as lesser human beings and men as oppressed by women is not unique to Bulgaria. Such content has been growing and spreading all over the world in recent years. Influencers like Andrew Tate, who faces charges of rape, bodily harm, human trafficking and more, have created a whole movement around this sort of content. Gyutsova fits neatly into this category of influencer, but what makes her different is that she is a woman. What role does feminism play? Dimitrova thinks one issue here is that feminism is often misunderstood. Feminism does not entail men being suppressed and women controlling them. It means that women can have equal rights and can function as equals to men not only in society but also in their personal relationships, she says. Dimitrova also believes that the patriarchal notion that men should not be allowed to express emotions is highly problematic. This is reflected in Gyutsova's content, which suggests that men are weak and not manly if they dare to express their fears, emotions or feelings.People in Sofia attend a protest against domestic violence and violence against women in Bulgaria in 2023 after a young woman was stabbed by her ex-partner Image: Alexandar Detev/DW It's a vicious circle: Men who are not allowed to express any sort of emotion for fear of being labeled weak don't know what to do when they experience something frustrating in their relationships and so they resort to aggression, says Dimitrova. What can be done? Dimitrova suggests that first and foremost, men should receive support and their concerns should not just be swept under the carpet. She stresses, however, that this support should not validate the inclination to deal with problems by exerting psychological or physical violence on women. Although the Emprove Foundation focuses primarily on women's rights and issues, it does have a project that focuses on men's mental health — something the foundation says is incredibly important in the fight against gender-based violence. Men should be encouraged to connect to a healthy understanding of themselves, so they can build healthy relationships as well, says Dimitrova. Petya Krasteva firmly believes that even though authorities in Bulgaria rarely provide the support needed in cases like this, society should not remain indifferent. We should be as loud as possible when something like this turns up, she says. We should be perfectly clear that it is unacceptable. That way, other people who come across this content will know that this is not something that society approves of, and that could help them realize that they shouldn't have anything to do with it. Dimitrova agrees. We will keep talking about it [this kind of content], calling it out and not tolerating it until the authorities wake up.

Why did an Argentinian court ordered an international warrant for her arrest?https://p.dw.com/p/4uJX3Aung San Suu Kyi has been imprisoned by the Myanmar military since 2021 (archive picture from 2012)Image: Loviny Christophe/ABACA/picture alliance AdvertisementIt is rare for an international arrest warrant to be issued against a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and political prisoner whose release is demanded by both the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council. However, this is precisely what occurred in February this year, when an Argentinian court asked for the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi. The court's decision applies to 25 Myanmar citizens wanted on charges linked to genocide and crimes against humanity. The list includes not only Myanmar's military leader Min Aung Hlaing, but also former State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and former President Htin Kyaw. Suu Kyi effectively served as Myanmar's top civilian leader before the military staged a coup in February 2021. She has been imprisoned ever since. The court in Argentina claims it has the jurisdiction to order a warrant for Suu Kyi's arrest based on a legal principle that some serious crimes can be prosecuted regardless of where they were committed. The specific case focuses on discrimination against Myanmar's Rohingya ethnic minority. The Muslim Rohingya live predominantly in the western state of Rakhine, and their status as citizens and as an ethnic group recognized by the state of Myanmar has been disputed for decades. The Rohingya crisis of 2017 Since 1988, Myanmar has seen an ongoing political conflict between the military and military-backed parties on one side and Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, on the other. In 2016, after many years of stalemate, the military and Aung San Suu Kyi reached a truce. A kind of dual government was established, with Aung San Suu Kyi heading the civilian branch and Min Aung Hlaing heading the military, which had constitutionally secured independence and far-reaching political rights. On October 9, 2016, Rohingya insurgents attacked several border and police posts of the Myanmar security forces. In August 2017, the security forces launched so-called clearance operations. As a result, thousands of Rohingya were killed and around 700,000 fled to neighboring Bangladesh, with exact figures still unclear due to the nature of the ethnically-charged conflict. Rohingya refugees fear increased hardship due to aid cutsTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video While the military denied using excessive force, international watchdogs and the UN agree that Myanmar's actions against the Rohingya constitute grave human rights violations. Still, two questions remain: First, did the offensive amount to genocide? Second, how much of it was the responsibility of Aung San Suu Kyi? The question of genocide Concerns that a genocide was happening in Myanmar have already been voiced before 2017. In 2015, the human rights organization Fortify Rights published a report with the Allard K. Lovenstein International Human Rights Clinic from Yale Law School in which was stated that there is strong evidence that genocide is being committed against Rohingya. Those voices only grew louder after 2017, and in November 2019, Gambia initiated a case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Myanmar, claiming violations of the UN's Genocide Convention. The ICJ has yet to rule on the case, however, meaning that the existence of genocide remains unconfirmed in a legal sense. But for human rights organizations like Fortify Rights, the Burmese-Rohingya Organization UK (BROUK) and the former UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar, Tomas Ojea Quintana, there is no doubt that genocide did take place. Quintana, an Argentinian, told Radio Free Asia that the court in his native country understood what was at stake, which is the genocide against the Rohingya people. The question of responsibility Aung San Suu Kyi was a globally renowned human rights advocate since the early 1990s until the events of 2017. She was also heading Myanmar's civilian government during the deadly wave of violence against the Rohingya. As chief councilor, she was notably hesitant to speak out against the military and even went to The Hague in 2019 to defend Myanmar at the International Court of Justice. She denied genocide was happening in Rakhine but admitted human rights violations, which would be investigated by Myanmar. She later confirmed this position in an interview with the Financial Times. War crimes were committed during the internal armed conflict with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army by members of Myanmar's security forces and civilians, she told the paper. At the same time, Aung San Suu Kyi pointed to a report by the Independent Commission of Enquiry (ICOE) which was set up by Myanmar without Rohingya representatives. The ICOE found no evidence of genocide, she told the paper, despite its report recording killing of civilians, disproportionate use of force, looting of property, and destruction of abandoned homes of Muslims. For those who believe Myanmar troops committed genocide against the Rohingya, Aung San Suu Kyi's refusal to recognize it makes her complicit. But does her stance — admitting that human rights violations happened but not genocide — mean Aung San Suu Kyi is guilty of committing genocide? What do we know about the Argentinian court order? The reasons behind the Argentinian court's decision to seek an international arrest warrant are not fully clear, as neither the ruling nor the exact evidence on which the ruling was based are publicly available. DW contacted the Argentinian court and the Argentinian human rights commission to get more information in the matter, but received no reply. The 2021 coup triggered protests in Myanmar, which eventually escalated into a civil war.Image: Sai Aung Main/AFP In the months following the announcement, Myanmar expert and former ambassador Derek Tonkin published an academic paper on the issue, examining the sources which most likely led to the arrest warrant. He writes that the petition [on which the decision of the court seems to be based] contains much narrative and opinion which are debatable and questionable, and in some areas are simply wrong. Commenting on the claim that Aung San Suu Kyi and others validated the genocide against the Rohingya, Tonkin states, it is not true and is supported by no evidence anywhere in the petition. Tonkin also rejects the accusation that Aung San Suu Kyi was directly responsible for the events in Rakhine State during her time as state counsellor at the time. I find this totally unconvincing. The Tatmadaw [the Myanmar military] refused to accept Aung San Suu Kyi's appointment, he writes. So far, the arrest warrant hasn't had any impact. Aung San Suu Kyi seems set to celebrate her 80th birthday next month as a prisoner in Myanmar as the civil war rages on. With the passage of time, the international arrest warrant might end up as a mere footnote in a long political career filled with legal battles.

They identified the deceased as Sandeep and Arif, residents of the B block area in Khayala. According to the police, a call was received from Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hospital to the Khayala police station about two men admitted with stab injuries between 10 pm and 11 pm. They both succumbed to injuries in the early hours of Monday. “As per the information available so far, two friends, who have known each other for years, were sitting in the park. An argument over something started between them, and it escalated to a scuffle. During the brawl, both of them stabbed each other using sharp-edged weapons,” said Vichitra Veer, Deputy Commissioner of Police, West. According to a police officer, neighbours saw the men lying injured in the park and rushed them to the hospital. Sandeep worked as a property dealer and previously as a gym trainer, said the police, adding that both men were married and had children. The park where the two were sitting was under the jurisdiction of Tilak Nagar police station. Teams from both Khayala and Tilak Nagar stations are now investigating the matter. The police are now questioning the neighbours and family members of the deceased to find the cause of the conflict between the two. They are reviewing CCTV footage from the area to establish the sequence of events. The bodies have been preserved for postmortem at the DDU Hospital Monday. Meanwhile, the Delhi Police crime data shows that 107 cases of murder were reported between January 1 and March 31 in 2025, a slight uptick from 105 in 2024 during the same period, but lower than 2023, when it was 115.

Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Mohali Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Harmandeep Singh Hans, said several special teams were constituted to trace the rising number of heinous crimes in the district. The operation was led by SP (Operations) Talwinder Singh, SP (PBI) Deepika Singh, DSP (City-2) Harsimran Singh Bal, and DSP (Economic Offences) Rajesh. Under this operation SHO Amandeep Singh and inspectors Gabbar Singh and Gagandeep carried out an investigation based on an FIR registered on July 12. According to the complainant, the incident occurred during the night of July 11–12, when she was returning from Best Tech Mall after watching a movie with her friend. Near Lakhnour turn, four bike-borne youths, dressed in Nihang attire, intercepted their car. The miscreants forcibly dragged her out of the vehicle and kidnapped her friend before fleeing the scene in the stolen car, the complaint stated. The SSP said that after assaulting the kidnapped boy, the accused threw him about 100 meters away. They then fled with the girl, kept her with them for approximately 30 minutes and later pushed her out near a gate before escaping towards Ambala. SSP Hans identified the arrested accused as Shamsher Singh, a resident of Gurdaspur; Satnam Singh (from Ludhiana), who works as a cab driver; Nirmal Singh (Nawanshahr), employed as a security guard; and Chander Mohan, alias Jaildar (Jammu), who also works as a security guard, All four were residing at a PG located behind Gurdwara Singh Shaheedan, Sohana in Mohali. Acting on a tip-off, police put the entire district on high alert. Multiple teams were deployed and after analysing the CCTV footage, the stolen vehicle was successfully traced. The accused were arrested from Chanarthal village under Sahabad police station, and the looted car was recovered. “These accused may be involved in other criminal cases as well. Interrogation is underway, and more revelations are expected,” Hans added.",7f251a7091a932c843ffae68035733e3ed5734782bce2e0aba302a91473a43d5,e9ffc2dbb5d1b5a0c5b8fd59dc708464

Sanjay Verma was shot dead on Monday at around 10 am, right outside his showroom in Abohar. According to eyewitnesses, three motorcycle-borne assailants lay in wait for him. The moment Verma stepped out of his car, they opened indiscriminate fire, killing him on the spot before fleeing the scene. While the shooters escaped and have yet to be identified, the Punjab Police announced the arrest of two of their accomplices, Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan, both residents of Patiala district, for helping the shooters escape in the car. However, within hours, both men were killed in a police encounter. This development has added fuel to the controversy. BJP General Secretary Manjinder Singh Sirsa accused the Punjab government of mishandling the law and order situation. On his visit to Chandigarh Wednesday, Sirsa said, “First of all, the Punjab government is not able to control the law and order and criminals… Punjab has become a police state. If Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has a clean image, he should get a CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) inquiry conducted into these encounters so the truth comes out.” Reacting sharply, AAP’s Punjab state president Aman Arora called the BJP’s stance “extremely shameful,” accusing it of siding with gangsters instead of supporting Verma’s bereaved family. Arora said, “While the entire Punjab stands with the family of Shri Sanjay Verma, Manjinder Singh Sirsa’s open support for gangsters today proves that the BJP is backing criminals even through central jails.” After meeting the family of Sanjay Verma on Monday, Arora had stated that gangsters lodged in jails outside Punjab were behind such heinous criminal activities. Whereas, Union Minister of State Ravneet Singh Bittu held the Mann government responsible for the ‘growing fear and lawlessness’ across Punjab. “Instead of owning up to their failure, AAP leaders are shamelessly pointing fingers at the Centre. This is not governance –it’s a complete abdication of duty,” he added. Bittu called Arora’s remarks “irresponsible” and “highly condemnable,” accusing him of trying to deflect attention from the AAP government’s failure to maintain law and order in the state. In a statement released on Monday, Bittu announced that he would write to the Governor of Punjab, urging him to take cognisance of Arora’s “baseless allegations”. He also sought written clarifications from Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav and Chief Secretary KAP Sinha, questioning whether Arora’s statement reflected the official position of the Bhagwant Mann-led government. “Aman Arora’s claim that gangster Lawrence Bishnoi is safe in Gujarat under the Centre’s protection is nothing but an excuse to hide the AAP government’s incompetence. These kinds of inflammatory and misleading remarks are both dangerous and unacceptable,” said Bittu. He reaffirmed that the central government has always taken a tough stance against terrorism and organised crime. “We conducted surgical strikes inside Pakistan when needed. Do you think gangsters are beyond our reach? Once the BJP forms government in Punjab, we’ll show what decisive action really looks like,” Bittu said. Pointing to the killing of Sanjay Verma, Bittu accused the Punjab government of completely surrendering to the gangster nexus. “Extortion threats and targeted killings have become the new normal for Punjab’s business community,” he said. Adding to the political slugfest, AAP’s Abohar constituency in-charge Arun Narang displayed a photo showing Abohar MLA Sandeep Jakhar with Shakti, a bike driver allegedly linked to the murder. Sandeep Jakhar, who is a suspended Congress MLA and nephew of Punjab BJP chief Sunil Jakhar, clarified that the picture was from the 2022 assembly election campaign. “Many people get pictures taken with us during campaigns. It’s illogical to link that picture to this crime,” he said. ‘We have full trust’ Jagat Verma, elder brother of Sanjay Verma, has expressed satisfaction over the police probe. In a video, Jagat Verma said, “We have full trust in the Punjab Police and we are satisfied with the ongoing police investigation. We humbly appeal to one and all to please stop doing politics over this issue. We appeal to the police to nab the rest of the culprits soon… We trust that we will get justice soon.” State of probe The police said their investigations have revealed that the getaway bike was driven by one Shakti, a daily wager from Azimgarh village of Abohar. While escaping, the attackers lost control of their bike and forcibly snatched another two-wheeler. They later abandoned it on Seeto Road and allegedly fled in a waiting Swift car, driven by Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan. Jaspreet Singh’s family has denied any involvement, alleging that he was picked up from his house in Mardankheri village of Patiala during the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday, and that they later received news of his death. They maintain that Jaspreet was a daily wager with no criminal background. The police said Jaspreet had a criminal background, and released a few pictures of him brandishing weapons. The details of his criminal record haven’t been revealed as of now. At the time of filing this report, the postmortem examination of Jaspreet and Ram was underway at the Abohar Civil Hospital under strict police cover. Meanwhile, gangster Aarzoo Bishnoi had claimed responsibility for the murder on social media, tagging Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar and Maharashtra’s Shivam Lonker hours after the murder. After the alleged encounter, Bishnoi again posted that the real shooters remained at large, and that Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan had no role in the killing. The Punjab unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has identified the Lawrence Bishnoi gang as the perpetrators behind this crime. The police, however, have not confirmed these claims nor provided clarity on the identities of the actual shooters.",e5f95abfc958db5d8cdbca385844d557be4c91c691308cd7d60da76720ec2964,110f9aeaaf40f7b999bac5a862114640

Their online conversations quickly grew into what seemed like a genuine relationship, and soon, talks of marriage followed. But the connection, which appeared to promise a shared future, turned out to be an elaborate cyber scam in which he was allegedly duped of a staggering Rs 1.55 crore over eight months. The investigation revealed that the cybercriminals, operating behind the profile of ‘Anamika,’ gradually gained the complainant’s trust and allegedly requested large sums of money. On the pretence of building a future together, ‘Anamika’ allegedly convinced him to transfer funds to purchase a house without ever having met. Over time, the scammers further manipulated him into investing in various trading apps, luring him with promises of exceptionally high returns, said the police. After spending nearly all his life savings and facing further demands for more money, he realised he had been deceived. When he tried to recover his funds, ‘Anamika’ allegedly abruptly stopped all communication with him. The police filed an FIR in March based on his complaint. The investigation by the cybercrime police station in Pimpri Chinchwad unearthed an elaborate network of mule account handlers allegedly operating from Solapur and with links to cybercriminals masterminding these scams from China. The police zeroed in on one particular mule account registered in Solapur in June. As the account holder was questioned, he spilled the beans on three others from Solapur who had allegedly told him that his bank account would be used for taking funds obtained from gaming applications. As the investigation dug deeper into these three suspects, the police established their identities and roles in the racket. The mule account handlers from Solapur have been identified as Shubham Chandrakant Mantha, 25, a resident of Ashok Chowk; Swapnil Chandulal Baheti, 35, a resident of Hotgi Road; and Prashik Uttam Navghare, 26, a resident of Juna Kumbhani Naka. “Our investigation revealed that Mantha worked for a China-headquartered payment application company, and he and Baheti were in direct contact with the masterminds based out of China. A coordinated search operation was launched for the trio as their roles were confirmed in the probe,” an officer who was part of the probe said. In the second week of June, Mantha and Navghare were arrested from Pune International Airport when they were about to flee to Nepal via Patna. Baheti, too, was placed under arrest. “Investigation revealed an elaborate mule handling and fund siphoning operation with direct links to China,” said an officer. All three suspects are currently in judicial custody.",9865caa283c9b9ddd31c4f3ac55f1c88767cac6e0a52108d705b0426b1b3413e,d113295a560ee830400d4ef5003f9379

The victim, identified as Sanjeev, 19, a resident of Rajiv Colony, Panchkula, had reportedly come to the area to meet a friend when he was attacked. According to police officials, Sanjeev was surrounded by three to four individuals around 10.30 pm. He was stabbed multiple times in the chest and abdomen with a knife, and then left critically injured on the roadside. The assailants fled the scene immediately after the attack. Soon after, a crowd gathered at the spot, and the PCR was informed. Sanjeev was rushed to the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, Chandigarh, where he succumbed to his injuries during treatment, the police said. The Chandigarh Police have apprehended two minors in connection with the crime. “An FIR has been registered, and the two juveniles have been booked for murder. They will be sent to a juvenile home,” said Vijay Singh, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Chandigarh Police. Sources revealed that the accused allegedly attacked Sanjeev because he was reportedly stalking their sister. The police have not ruled out the involvement of more individuals and are continuing their investigation. Meanwhile, the preliminary postmortem report has stated that the victim died due to punctured vital organs caused by the stabbings. The incident has triggered tension in the area, with residents demanding increased police patrolling and swift justice. Teenager injured in stabbing attack in Sector 40 A 19-year-old teenager was critically injured in a targeted stabbing attack by a group of around half a dozen minors in Block C of Sector 40 in Chandigarh on Sunday night. The assault is suspected to be a result of personal enmity. According to the police, the attackers arrived on three to four motorbikes and were not wearing helmets. They attacked the youth and fled the scene within seconds. The victim was initially rushed by his family members to a private hospital in Mohali, but was later shifted to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, Chandigarh. Chiranji Lal, Station House Officer (SHO), Sector-39 Police Station, confirmed that the attack appeared to be premeditated and due to a personal dispute.

But when public figures cross legal lines, the consequences unfold not just in courtrooms but also under the relentless scrutiny of the public eye. One name that recently forced this uncomfortable truth into the spotlight is Sean “Diddy” Combs, the hip-hop mogul and music industry titan who, after years of whispers and lawsuits, has now been convicted in a federal court. In July 2025, a jury found Combs guilty on two felony counts of transportation to engage in prostitution under the Mann Act, a law dating back to 1910. These charges relate to the coerced travel of his former partner, singer Cassie Ventura, and another woman identified only as “Jane,” both of whom testified during the trial. Combs was acquitted on three other charges, including racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking. Still, the guilty verdict marks a seismic fall for the 55-year-old artist once synonymous with glamour, success, and cultural dominance. Diddy’s story is far from unique. Over the years, several A-listers have been convicted of crimes — from drug possession and assault to manslaughter and tax evasion. This listicle delves into 10 high-profile celebrities with criminal records, focusing only on those with confirmed legal outcomes. Once a towering figure in global music, Diddy’s legacy has been rocked by criminal convictions. In a 2025 federal trial, he was found guilty of two counts of transporting women – including ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura – for prostitution, under the Mann Act. Though acquitted of more serious charges like racketeering and sex trafficking, the felony convictions carry serious legal and reputational consequences. More fallout may follow. Attorney Tony Buzbee claims over 100 men and women have accused Diddy of rape and assault. One woman alleged she was gang raped at age 17 after being drugged at a 2003 party. While Combs’s team dismisses the lawsuits as publicity stunts, the convictions have added weight to the mounting allegations. Sanjay Dutt’s conviction remains one of the most talked-about legal sagas in Indian cinema. In 1993, following the devastating Mumbai bomb blasts, Dutt was arrested under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) for illegally possessing an AK-56 rifle, which was part of a consignment linked to the bombings. Though he was acquitted of terrorism charges, he was convicted in 2006 under the Arms Act for illegal possession of firearms. After years of legal proceedings and appeals, Dutt was sentenced to five years in prison and ultimately served over four years, including time at Yerwada Central Jail. Before becoming Tony Stark, Robert Downey Jr. was one of Hollywood’s most tragic cautionary tales. Struggling with addiction in the 90s, Downey was repeatedly arrested for possession of heroin, cocaine, and unlicensed firearms. He was famously found wandering into a neighbour’s house under the influence and passed out in their bed. In 1999, after multiple probation violations, he was sentenced to three years in prison, though he served roughly a year before early release. In 2009, Bollywood actor Shiney Ahuja was arrested for raping his domestic help—a case that sent shockwaves through the film industry. Though the victim later recanted her statement, the court found the original testimony credible and convicted Ahuja in 2011 under Section 376 (rape) and other charges. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, though he spent about three years in jail before being released on bail pending appeal. Wesley Snipes’ high-flying Hollywood career hit a wall when he was convicted in 2008 on three misdemeanor counts of failing to file federal income tax returns. Prosecutors claimed he hadn’t paid taxes for years, despite earning tens of millions. Though he was acquitted of the more severe felony tax fraud charges, he still served nearly three years in prison. In 1992, boxing champion Mike Tyson was convicted of raping 18-year-old Desiree Washington, a beauty pageant contestant, in an incident that took place at a hotel in Indianapolis in July 1991. The jury found Tyson guilty after about 10 hours of deliberation, rejecting his defense that the encounter was consensual. Tyson was sentenced to six years in prison and served approximately three years before being released on parole in 1995. The conviction shocked the sports world and dramatically altered Tyson’s public image overnight, marking a significant turning point in his career. Despite this setback, Tyson later returned to the boxing ring and expanded his career into entertainment, including notable acting roles such as in The Hangover film series. In 2001, Stranger Things star Winona Ryder was arrested for shoplifting over $5,500 worth of merchandise from a Beverly Hills Saks Fifth Avenue store. She was later convicted of felony grand theft and vandalism, receiving three years’ probation, 480 hours of community service, and fines. The incident damaged her career for years, leading to a hiatus from leading roles in Hollywood. Ryder eventually made a well-received comeback, and her 2000s-era troubles are now often seen as part of the conversation around mental health and celebrity pressure. Shia LaBeouf is known for his acting talent as well as his history of erratic behaviour and legal troubles. Over the years, he has been arrested multiple times for offenses such as disorderly conduct, public intoxication, and drunk driving. One of the most notable incidents occurred in 2017, when LaBeouf was arrested in Savannah, Georgia, for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. During this arrest, he was caught on camera making a racially charged outburst toward police officers. These incidents, along with other arrests for similar behavior, have contributed to his reputation for instability. LaBeouf has also faced civil lawsuits from former partners, most prominently from singer FKA Twigs, who accused him of sexual battery and emotional abuse. While he has not been criminally convicted in these civil cases, the combination of his legal issues and public controversies has overshadowed his career achievements, leading many to view him as a cautionary example of wasted potential in Hollywood. Before becoming a blockbuster actor and producer, Mark Wahlberg had a violent and troubling past. At 16, Wahlberg was charged with attempted murder after assaulting two Vietnamese men during a racially motivated attack. He was convicted of assault and served 45 days in prison. The case drew renewed attention in 2014 when Wahlberg applied for a pardon, sparking criticism from civil rights groups and raising questions about accountability and privilege. Wahlberg has publicly acknowledged his past and expressed remorse, though his request for a pardon was ultimately dropped. Phil Spector, the music genius behind the Wall of Sound, became infamous for a far more sinister reason. In 2009, he was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2003 death of actress Lana Clarkson, who was found shot in his mansion. The trial, his second, after a hung jury, ended in a conviction and a 19-years-to-life prison sentence. Spector died in custody in 2021.",73697cd66a0be055d4dc8648c5cf018f30e228abbd24ff6c1604b1ab6fa4aac5,1676ed0148c17932b20d45559413e540

The doctor received two bullet injuries, and his condition is critical, they said. Ajay Gandhi, Senior Superintendent of Police, Moga, said Dr Aniljit Kamboj, who is in his fifties, was shot at by two men who came to his Harbans Nursing Home at around 2 pm. “The doctor was treating one of them, and discussing medicines when the second man who was standing behind opened fire. Two bullets hit the doctor, including one in the chest. He has been admitted to a private hospital in Moga, and his condition is critical. He is on ventilator,” Gandhi told The Indian Express. He said the police are probing the case from all angles, and checking CCTV footage to identify the suspects. A family member told The Indian Express that Kamboj had received extortion calls from Canada-based designated terrorist Lakhbir Singh Landa, an operative of the banned organization Babbar Khalsa International (BKI). The threat calls were being received since 2022 and the caller was demanding at least Rs 1 crore, said the family member, requesting anonymity. He further said that Kamboj was also given a security cover by the Moga Police but the lone gunman was withdrawn some months ago. Moga SP (investigation) Bal Krishan Singla, said: “An FIR was registered in 2022 after Dr Kamboj had received threat calls. Landa was nominated as an accused in that FIR. However, the family did not inform us about any such latest incident.” Asked if the security cover was withdrawn, he said: “They were having the security cover till some time ago but currently, they had no such threat perception. I would need to check the latest status of their security cover.” The CCTV footage of two suspects who shot Dr Aniljit Kamboj at his clinic in Moga district, Friday. The suspects posed as patients.

Kamboj, a general physician, had solemnized second marriage after the death of his wife. His stepdaughter Tania is a known Punjabi actor. Harjot Kaur said that her father-in-law is on ventilator support after the surgery. “He received two bullet injuries, of which one exited his body. His blood pressure is not stable and he is on ventilator.” “My husband was at the clinic with him. Two men came and posed as patients. One of them told my father-in-law that he was having some skin related ailment. As soon as he bent down to check his leg, the other man who was standing behind opened fire at him,” she said. Inspector Gurwinder Singh Bhullar, SHO Kot Ise Khan, said that the case was being probed from all angles including Landa’s alleged involvement. “Prima facie, the man who opened fire had two weapons and he opened fire with both,” said the SHO. The inspector said that an FIR for attempt to murder was being registered at Kot Ise Khan police station on the statement of Chahat. “We will nominate names of the accused as the probe will progresses,” he said. “The doctor had received extortion calls in the past and was also given the security cover.

The deceased have been identified as dhaba owner Siddarodh Tugudi, 35, his nephew Jagadish Belamagi, 28, and employee Ramanna Bhosga, 40. The police said that the triple murders were in retaliation to a killing that occurred in November last year in connection with a feud between two families who belong to the same village. According to the police, Tugudi and his brothers had murdered a criminal identified as Somu Talikoti over a financial dispute and were released on bail recently. To avenge Talikot’s death, four of his brothers along with associates reportedly orchestrated Wednesday’s attack, the police said. “The police have been warning the families after the murder that took place last year. They belong to the same caste and are relatives. We suspect that these murders were carried out in revenge,” said Kalaburagi City Police Commissioner Sharanappa S D on Thursday. The assailants allegedly stormed the dhaba at 12.45 am, targeting Siddarodh and Jagadish, the police said, adding that they have recovered crucial CCTV footage from a nearby petrol station. The accused had damaged the CCTVs installed at the dhaba. “When the dhaba employees attempted to flee through the back door toward an agricultural field, the attackers pursued them. In the chaos, they killed Ramanna, mistaking him for one of Siddarodh’s brothers.

The accused were riding a motorcycle with a temporary number plate when they were intercepted by the police. Police said that the arrests are linked to the firing incident that took place on the intervening night of June 20-21. According to the complainant, Samdarsh Kumar, a resident of Ramdarbar and a property dealer, an unknown person had fired at his car parked outside his house, shattering a window pane.

The police have recovered one country-made pistol along with four live cartridges from Monu, and one country-made weapon with a live cartridge from Pawan. Monu has a criminal background and was previously involved in a 2022 murder case registered at PS 17, Chandigarh, police claimed.

The accused — Sandeep Jawahar Shah, a resident of Solapur, and Salim Khubbuddin Patel, a resident of Navi Mumbai — were arrested in Mumbai and Sangli earlier this month. As per the CBI, it discovered that the two were involved in duping NEET candidates and their parents by falsely claiming to have connections with officials of the National Testing Agency (NTA) that conducts the examination. As per the CBI, Shah initially demanded Rs 90 lakh from each candidate and agreed to accept Rs 87.5 lakh per candidate. The central agency claimed that Shah and Patel would assure candidates that they would receive details of their purportedly increased marks six hours before the official declaration of results. The accused sought to be released on bail on the grounds that probe was completed and their custodial interrogation was not required. The pleas claimed that there was no recovery at the instance of the applicants and they’ll co-operate with the trial after being released on bail. The CBI, however, opposed the pleas stating that the same be rejected as there other accused persons are yet to be arrested and therefore the custodial interrogation of present applicants would be required. However, special judge VP Desai observed that till date (on June 21) “the investigating officer has nothing concrete to show that till what period the other accused will be arrested”. Merely because the other accused persons are yet to be arrested cannot be a ground for rejection of the bail, the judge added. The court further noted that offence under section 7(A) of Prevention of the Corruption (PC) Act is not punishable in imprisonment of life or death and punishment prescribed is not less than three years but will extend to seven years. “Nothing is brought on record against the applicant that he will not be available for trial. Hence discretion in the nature of bail can be exercised in the favour of applicants,” the court held and granted bail to the two on furnishing personal bond of Rs 50,000 each along with other terms and conditions.",4974f52e05170329fc61b34918e72435efd9c5cfb80bb908d716d1ecea37e141,772d6209c825a13e8bd82758db7362e1

(Supplied: AFP)The drugs were removed and the consignment was delivered to a warehouse in Bowen Hills, in Brisbane's inner north.Australian Federal Police allege the three men were in the vicinity of the warehouse when it was delivered. Two of the men allegedly began to unravel the rolls of fabric, as the 24-year-old attended a business to buy an electronic scale to allegedly weigh the illicit drugs they were expecting, ABF and AFP said in a joint statement.Police said that during subsequent search warrants of the warehouse and two vehicles, investigators found and seized the contents of the consignment, four mobile phones, about $7,000 cash, and tools suspected to be used in accessing the methamphetamine. Inquiries into the criminal syndicate remain ongoing, police said.The men, aged 22, 24 and 28, from New South Wales have each been charged with one count of attempting to possess a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported border-controlled drug. Tony Nguyen and Ky Brendan did not appear in the Brisbane Magistrates Court when their matters were briefly heard for the first time on Wednesday.Martin Nguyen appeared via video link and applied for bail, but it was refused.All three were remanded in custody and their matters were adjourned until August.Border force officers say they uncovered 597kg of methamphetamine wrapped inside 200 rolls of fabric. (Supplied: AFP)'Six million individual street deals'AFP Detective Superintendent Adrian Telfer said the result demonstrated the commitment to combating transnational organised crime and illicit drug trafficking. The people behind importations like this have no regard for the harm and damage that illicit drugs wreak on the Australian community every minute of every day, Det Supt Telfer said. Methamphetamine is a devastating drug and causes harm not just to the user, but also their loved ones and the wider community. This amount of methamphetamine could have resulted in about six million individual street deals. ABF Acting Assistant Commissioner James Copeman said it was an incredibly sophisticated concealment that could have easily evaded detection . The sheer volume of methamphetamine hidden within legitimate-looking fabric rolls speaks to the lengths criminal syndicates will go to, but it also highlights the extraordinary capability of ABF officers to detect and disrupt even the most convincing smuggling attempts, he said.Posted 51m ago51 minutes agoWed 16 Jul 2025 at 1:08am, updated 45m ago45 minutes agoWed 16 Jul 2025 at 1:14amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesConvicted killer Bradley Murdoch dies 24 years after Peter Falconio's murderTopic:CrimePhoto shows A man in a pale shirt is held by a serious-looking police officer.Watch what happens when ADF soldiers fire the Carl Gustaf recoilless rifleTopic:Defence ForcesPhoto shows Two soldiers on the ground in camoflauge firing a Carl Gustaf weapon.

We remind the public that the reward for information relating to the disappearance of Peter Falconio has been recently increased. Murdoch was born in the small West Australian town of Northampton in 1958.His life before prison involved working as a mechanic, driving trucks and running drugs across outback Australia.He was 43 when he killed Mr Falconio.In 2001, Mr Falconio and his girlfriend, Joanne Lees, were exploring Central Australia together in what was supposed to be a memorable outback holiday.Joanne Lees and Peter Falconio during their trip to Australia. (AAP)The British tourists were travelling in a Kombi van at night along the Stuart Highway, about 10 kilometres north of Barrow Creek, when Murdoch gestured for them to pull over from his ute.Soon after Mr Falconio hopped out of the driver's seat to talk to Murdoch, a gunshot was heard.The black electrical cable handcuffs Murdoch used to bind Joanne Lees's hands behind her back. (Stringer: Reuters)Murdoch then assaulted Ms Lees, bound her wrists with cable ties and electrical tape and forced her into his vehicle.Ms Lees somehow managed to escape into nearby bushland, and Murdoch drove off into the darkness.Mr Falconio was never seen again.The Kombi van belonging to Joanne Lees and Peter Falconio. (David Gerhaty: Reuters)The 28-year-old's mysterious death ignited a wave of international media attention, partly inspiring the 2005 Australian horror film Wolf Creek.Mr Falconio's family and Ms Lees were thrust into the spotlight in both Australia and the United Kingdom, with Ms Lees subjected to particularly intense scrutiny.Twenty-four years after their son disappeared, parents Joan and Luciano Falconio still do not know what happened to his remains.Murdoch never revealed the location of the young man's body.An undated photo of Peter Falconio and Joanne Lees that was shown during the trial at the Supreme Court in Darwin. (AAP)Catching a killerDuring the early months of the police investigation, when hundreds of suspects were still being treated as persons of interest, there was a major breakthrough — a man reported he knew who did it.He gave the name of Bradley John Murdoch.Police moved quickly and took a DNA sample from Murdoch, who had been arrested in South Australia over allegations he abducted and raped a 12-year-old girl and her mother.The Crown case rested on Ms Lees's ability to identify Murdoch from photographs, as well as DNA evidence linking him to the crime using a blood sample taken from the scene.A police mugshot of Bradley John Murdoch. (Getty Images: Northern Territory Police)The item that ultimately condemned Murdoch was an elastic hair tie found in his ute that belonged to Ms Lees.Former NT police officer Colleen Gwynne, who was the lead investigator in the Falconio case, said an eagle-eyed police officer in her team had noticed the hair tie wrapped around Murdoch's holster while trawling through his belongings.Ms Gwynne told the ABC in 2016 that Murdoch probably didn't know how significant the hair tie was , and suggested he kept it as a trophy .Colleen Gwynne was the lead investigator on the Peter Falconio case. (Supplied)In 2005, Murdoch was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Mr Falconio and attempted kidnapping of Ms Lees, with a non-parole period of 28 years.The court heard Murdoch had put Mr Falconio's body into his ute before dumping it somewhere between Alice Springs and Broome.During sentencing, Chief Justice Brian Martin described Murdoch's offending as nothing short of cowardly in the extreme .He said Murdoch's prospects of rehabilitation were low given his complete lack of remorse and prior offending.Murdoch was acquitted of the rape allegations in South Australia in 2003, immediately before police arrested and charged him over the Falconio case.He had also served time in jail in WA in the mid-1990s for shooting at a crowd of Aboriginal football fans celebrating a victory in Fitzroy Crossing.Bradley John Murdoch being taken to the Darwin police watch house to be formally charged with murder. (AAP)During his two decades behind bars, Murdoch always maintained his innocence.He appealed to overturn his convictions twice, but was unsuccessful.In 2016, the NT government introduced no body, no parole laws with the aim of eliciting a confession from Murdoch by removing his right to parole in 2032.It did not work.This year, NT Police launched a fresh public appeal by offering a new reward of $500,000 for information on Mr Falconio's remains.Acting Commander Mark Grieve from NT Police's Crime and Intelligence Command previously stated in June that police had been speaking to Murdoch. On all occasions, he's chosen not to positively engage with police, he said.Murdoch was transferred to the Alice Springs Correctional Centre in 2022, after previously being housed at Darwin's Holtze prison.His death in custody will be subject to a mandatory coronial inquest.Posted 4h ago4 hours agoTue 15 Jul 2025 at 9:14pm, updated 3h ago3 hours agoTue 15 Jul 2025 at 10:22pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesWatch what happens when ADF soldiers fire the Carl Gustaf recoilless rifleTopic:Defence ForcesPhoto shows Two soldiers on the ground in camoflauge firing a Carl Gustaf weapon.

Kylie Stott, Dimitri D'Elio and Danny Clarke pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, murder and arson in a nearly seven-week trial that heard from emergency services, DNA experts, police officers, and pathologists, and was described by a prosecutor as a case about retribution .The jury was shown photos taken by Victoria Police of the burnt car, which contained the remains of Charlie Gander's body. (Supplied: Supreme Court of Victoria)The jury delivered its verdict at Victoria's Supreme Court on Tuesday afternoon, finding D'Elio, who was aged 24 at the time of offending, guilty of all three charges.Stott, who was aged 37 at the time, in a relationship with D'Elio, and described by the prosecution as orchestrating the scheme, was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, guilty of kidnapping and not guilty of arson. The jury found Clarke, who was 38 at the time of offending, guilty of kidnapping and not guilty of murder, manslaughter and arson. All three accused were expressionless as the verdict was read to the court.The prosecution told the jury that the trio was motivated by a desire for revenge. (Supplied: Gander family)A desire for revengeDuring the opening days of the trial, Crown prosecutor Mark Gibson said the court would hear a case about retribution and a desire to punish a person for what they believed they had done.He alleged the trio acted as a team to kidnap, kill and incinerate Mr Gander in an unnecessary, senseless and callous act.Mr Gibson told the court the alleged motive was Mr Gander's cooperation with police investigating a firearms breach by Tyson May, who was a good friend of Stott.Gander's body was found on Christmas Eve 2022. (Supplied: Gander family)Following a police raid in Shepparton in November 2022, Mr Gander gave a police interview and made a witness statement about Mr May possessing a firearm.Mr May was under a firearms prohibition order, Mr Gibson said.A disc with the record of Mr Gander's police interview found its way into the hands of others and cost Mr Gander dearly , Mr Gibson said.The court heard that Mr Gander received a copy of his police interview, which he mistakenly left behind at the accuseds' residence.Mr Gibson presented evidence to the court, including Google searches from D'Elio's phone for a dead body in burned car several days before media coverage of the death, as well as records from Stott's phone labelling the victim as Charlie dead dog Gander .As part of court evidence, the jury travelled from Melbourne to Shepparton, Bunbartha and Nathalia to view key locations in the case.A court appearance to schedule plea dates has been set for later this month.Posted 17h ago17 hours agoTue 15 Jul 2025 at 8:34am, updated 31m ago31 minutes agoWed 16 Jul 2025 at 1:29amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesConvicted killer Bradley Murdoch dies 24 years after Peter Falconio's murderTopic:CrimePhoto shows A man in a pale shirt is held by a serious-looking police officer.Watch what happens when ADF soldiers fire the Carl Gustaf recoilless rifleTopic:Defence ForcesPhoto shows Two soldiers on the ground in camoflauge firing a Carl Gustaf weapon.

(ABC News: Dane Hirst)In short:The Northern Territory's police union president says a death or serious incident in custody is inevitable under the dangerous conditions inside the Palmerston police watch house. One recently released detainee said the women's cells were stained with period blood, while another said men had to s**t in front of everyone in cells of up to 16 people.The NT's prison population has soared to record highs in recent months, partly driven by the introduction of tougher bail laws.abc.net.au/news/nt-police-union-warns-of-death-custody-in-watch-house-conditions/105534016Link copiedShareShare articleThe Northern Territory's police union is warning a death or serious incident in custody is only a matter of time under dangerous conditions inside police watch houses.Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that this article contains the name and image of an Indigenous person who has died, used with the permission of their family.Their caution comes amid national attention on Aboriginal deaths in custody, after the NT coroner last week delivered her inquest findings into the 2019 police shooting of Kumanjayi Walker in Yuendumu. It also follows the recent deaths in custody of Warlpiri man Kumanjayi White in Alice Springs and a senior Kardu Rak Kirnmu elder at Royal Darwin Hospital. In a statement, the NT Police Association (NTPA) said 92 detainees were kept in the Palmerston police watch house on Monday, including 76 overflow corrections prisoners.NTPA president Nathan Finn says he's worried about the safety of police officers. (ABC News: Pete Garnish) This is officially out of control, NTPA president Nathan Finn said in a statement. It's not a matter of if, but when a serious custody incident occurs. The growing pressure on police comes just four months after the NT government promised to stop housing corrections prisoners at watch houses in Palmerston and Alice Springs.Corrections Minister Gerard Maley told parliament on March 18 that all prisoners had been moved out of the watch houses and into prisons in Holtze and Berrimah. Mr Finn told the ABC he was extremely concerned by another spike in corrections prisoners held inside watch houses. It's going to end up in a situation where a police officer is hurt, or an inmate in that facility is hurt or killed, he said. We've got no contingencies if someone gets violent. If someone has a mental health episode inside that facility, it's further placing our staff at unacceptable risk. Former detainees describe unhygienic conditionsFormer detainee Willis John Carlow, who was released on Tuesday after 10 days in the Palmerston watch house, said the conditions were horrible . We had to s**t in front of everyone and there was no space, just 10 other people — 16 other people — in one space, he said. You've got to eat while they're taking a s**t so it was pretty bad. Recently released detainees say the conditions inside Palmerston watch house are horrible . (ABC News: Hamish Harty)Another former detainee, who was also released on Tuesday but wished to remain anonymous, said the women's cells were stained with period blood. You've got eight girls crammed into one cell — girls who are on their periods and are not even being allowed to have showers, she said. We're all in this room with someone else's period blood all over the sheets and it's just pushed into a pile against the wall. She said the female inmates had created a barricade of mattresses around the cell's toilet for privacy from male correctional officers walking past. You've got one blocked toilet and then one toilet that barely works and we're supposed to be drinking water from bubblers on top of the toilet, she said. There was a pregnant woman in there who had stomach pains … and for two weeks in a row was asking to see medical [staff]. A Northern Territory Police spokesperson said all watch houses were managed through strict policy, procedures and instructions . The primary consideration in relation to people in police custody is the safety and welfare of the individual, the spokesperson said in a statement. All persons in custody are provided with basic necessities and are treated with respect. Backlog in courts contributing to chaosThe NT's prison population has soared in recent months, partly driven by the NT government's introduction of tougher bail laws.Data from the NT corrections department shows 2,847 prisoners were being held at correctional facilities on Tuesday, including 1,492 at Darwin Correctional Centre. About half of those prisoners are people on remand who have not yet been sentenced or found guilty. Inside the watch house at the police headquarters in Berrimah. (ABC News: Michael Donnelly)The overflow of prisoners is playing out in the courts. More than 185 court matters were listed between just two sitting judges at Darwin Local Court on Tuesday, giving judges about three minutes on average to process each matter. Mr Finn said the NT government had failed to support its tough-on-crime agenda with appropriate infrastructure to cope with rising prisoner numbers. This government continues to beat its chest about locking up more offenders, but it has utterly failed to plan for the consequences of its own policies, he said.Mr Finn also claimed overcrowding inside watch houses was preventing police officers from making arrests. We've heard from a number of members coming through that limitations in watch house space has led to arrests not being made, he said.Gerard Maley said individuals need to stop breaking the law . (ABC News: Pete Garnish)In a statement, Mr Maley said while the government was working to expand corrections infrastructure as quickly as possible , there was no alternative to currently keeping prisoners in watch houses. Police will continue arresting those who break the law, and corrections will continue expanding capacity to ensure those who are remanded or sentenced have a bed, he said. An extra 238 beds are expected to be operational at the Berrimah Correctional Centre by mid-August. That's in addition to the more than 500 new beds in Darwin and Alice Springs that the CLP has delivered since taking office last August. A department spokesperson said correctional staff have not operated out of the Palmerston police watch house since mid-March.LoadingPosted 17h ago17 hours agoTue 15 Jul 2025 at 8:19am, updated 16h ago16 hours agoTue 15 Jul 2025 at 9:17amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesConvicted killer Bradley Murdoch dies 24 years after Peter Falconio's murderTopic:CrimePhoto shows A man in a pale shirt is held by a serious-looking police officer.Watch what happens when ADF soldiers fire the Carl Gustaf recoilless rifleTopic:Defence ForcesPhoto shows Two soldiers on the ground in camoflauge firing a Carl Gustaf weapon.

Mr Young, 23, has admitted to killing Ms McGuire and dumping her body, although he denies that he is guilty of her murder.

(Supplied: GoFundMe)Ms McGuire's family reported her missing in April last year, and the 23-year-old's body was later found in a burnt-out vehicle at Scarsdale, south-west of Ballarat.Giving evidence on Tuesday, Mr O'Keefe, 23, told the court that Mr Young asked him to convoy with him into bushland so he had a ride home after planning to crash Ms McGuire's car with her, unconscious, at the wheel. He wanted to put her in her car and roll her down a hill … because she was leaving him and she was going to take the house and other things, Mr O'Keefe told the court. I was supposed to meet him at 12 at night on the corner and follow him in the car, then give him a lift home. Mr O'Keefe said he told Mr Young he could not do it, and tried ignoring his messages, but after a few requests, agreed. He told the court he followed Mr Young in the early hours of April 5, 2024 out to the Scarsdale location, all of which the prosecution corroborated with CCTV footage from the night.Mr O'Keefe told jurors that at no point did he see inside the vehicle Mr Young was driving.Benjamin O'Keefe told the court Lachlan Young planned to roofie Hannah McGuire and roll her down a hill in her car.

You get in more trouble with a fire,' Mr O'Keefe said. Lachie [Young] drives off and I follow him … he drove down the road then swerved the car and crashed it into a tree. Mr O'Keefe told the court he then watched in his rear-view mirror as Mr Young used a yellow blowtorch to set the two front seats of Ms McGuire's vehicle, with her in it, on fire.Mr Young paid him $45 for his assistance.Danielle McCann was a safety officer at Delacombe Primary School where Hannah McGuire worked.

After the intervention order was served, Ms McCann said Ms McGuire continued to receive threats from Mr Young. I asked, 'Are you safe?' Her reply was, 'I don't know,' Ms McCann told the court.Other work friends of Ms McGuire's gave evidence Mr Young was horrible and disrespectful to her during their relationship, including multiple incidents where they witnessed him yelling, using expletives, and calling her fat.Ms McGuire's work friend Jaymie McDonald told the court Ms McGuire would often break down in tears over her relationship with Mr Young.The court also heard how Mr Young phoned and messaged Ms McGuire's friends repeatedly in the hours after she was killed, accusing them of hiding Ms McGuire and causing her death. When I spoke to him, he was asking me where Hannah was … he was quite accusational that I had Hannah at my house and was hiding her from him, Abby Simpson, another of Ms McGuire's work colleagues, told the court during evidence.A floral tribute at the scene where Hannah McGuire's remains were found. (AAP: Con Chronis)The court was shown Ms Simpson's phone logs, which indicated Mr Young attempted to call her dozens of times between 5 and 6am the morning Ms McGuire was killed.He also sent Ms Simpson multiple messages stating: Where the f*** is she?… F*** me, if someone has done something to her, I will end their life.

(Supplied)In short:Jaydn Stimson, who killed SA Police officer Jason Doig in a shooting in 2023, has been ordered to mental health supervision for the rest of his life.Sergeant Michael Hutchinson — who was also shot in the incident — said he did not hate Stimson but never wanted to see him again.Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said the shooting had had significant impact on the wider policing community.abc.net.au/news/jaydn-stimson-sentenced-for-shooting-police-officer-jason-doig/105530072Link copiedShareShare articleNursing his own wounds and cradling his dying colleague in his arms, Sergeant Michael Hutchinson has recounted the life-changing moment of being ambushed by an armed and mentally-unwell man.In a victim impact statement read to South Australia's Supreme Court on Tuesday, Sergeant Hutchinson said he had known the shooter — Jaydn Harley Stimson — since he was five.He was called to a property at Senior, near Bordertown, in November 2023 for a welfare check on Mr Stimson, which he attended with his colleagues Brevet Sergeant Jason Doig and Senior Constable Rebekah Cass.Brevet Sergeant Doig was fatally shot in the incident, while Sergeant Hutchinson was also shot twice — in the head and torso — but survived.In April, Stimson, 27, was found not guilty of the murder of Brevet Sergeant Jason Doig, and the attempted murder of Sergeant Hutchinson due to mental incompetence.The court has now ordered he be subject to mental health supervision for the rest of his life — after hearing victim impact statements from the officers, Brevet Sergeant Doig's family, the Lucindale community and SA Police.Sergeant Michael Hutchinson spoke outside court after Jadyn Stimson was sentenced. (ABC News)Sergeant Hutchinson told the court the officers were attending the property after Stimson became involved in a fight with his brother — and later returned with weapons and shot his dog. I honestly believe if your brother or father were home you would have used your firearms on them, he said.He said while searching for Stimson inside the home, the officers were ambushed and shot, with Brevet Sergeant Doig suffering wounds to his neck and chest. Despite all my efforts to save Jason, he died in my arms, he said. The guilt I carry that Jason died on my watch is something I will live with for the rest of my life. Jaydn Stimson was found not guilty due to mental incompetence. (Facebook)He said his memories of the night were haunting and that despite operations to remove pellet wounds from his body, six still remained inside.He told the court the psychological impact of the incident was ongoing and the ripple effects were far-reaching. He said while he had spent 39 years in the force he would be known for the shooting instead of the countless hours he spent serving the community.Despite this, he said he did not hate Stimson — who was nothing to me now . I hope I never see you again, he said.'It's burnt into my memory'Senior Constable Rebekah Cass told the court she was two extra steps away from being in the room when she heard the gunshots. I had no idea where the sounds were coming from, no idea where my colleagues were, no idea if someone had been shot or if I was next, she said. It turns out, if I had taken two extra steps I would have been in that room, possibly shot, possibly dead.Senior Constable Rebekah Cass was awarded for her bravery during the shooting at Senior, near Bordertown. (Supplied: SA Police) Two steps, that's all it took to change everything. The chaos, the disorientation — it's burnt into my memory. She said she entered the room to a scene which would haunt her for the rest of her life, finding Brevet Sergeant Doig on the ground and Sergeant Hutchinson crouched over. I moved forward and saw that the body on the ground was Jason. Jason was still alive, struggling to breathe — there was blood, so much blood. He was trying to speak and I told him over and over: 'I'm here, I've got you … help is on the way'. I did everything I could to keep him alive. I stayed with him and I spoke with him until his last words She said she desperately called for help on her radio when Brevet Sergeant Doig died, and checked on Stimson.Senior Constable Cass said her one regret was that she had asked the two other officers to attend the job by her side after it was tasked to her and she had unknowingly led them into a nightmare . If I had gone alone, I wouldn't be standing here today — and that thought lives with me every single day, she said. You didn't just kill a police officer, you destroyed countless lives in a single senseless moment of violence. She said it was made more difficult because it was unlikely Stimson would ever understand what he had done.Ever since the incident she said she suffered flashbacks and had changed how she lived, worked and moved throughout the world.'This was entirely preventable'Senior Constable Cass said the system had failed her colleagues by allowing Stimson to be a registered gun owner. This didn't have to happen, this was entirely preventable, she said.Sean Evans says Brevet Sergeant Jason Doig's parents are grieving. (ABC News: Guido Salazar)Sean Evans, a close family friend of Brevet Sergeant Doig read a victim impact statement to the court on behalf of Jason's mother Faye Edwards, in which she described the deep unrelenting sorrow that never goes away . No parent should ever have to bury their child and yet that is the reality that you forced upon me and his family, she wrote. I will never again hear his voice, see his smile or feel his embrace. I often wonder if you truly understand what you have done, if you think about Jason, if you think about the people left behind who will never recover from this. I hope one day you fully grasp the weight of your actions and feel the burden of that for the rest of your life. I will never forget Jason, I will never stop loving him. And I will never stop grieving. What you took from us is beyond measure. The court also heard statements from Brevet Sergeant Doig's step-father and brother.Director of Public Prosecutions, Martin Hinton KC, read a victim impact statement to the court on behalf of the Lucindale community, where Brevet Sergeant Doig was a much-valued and energetic local often affectionately referred to as Action Jason . He was always there to help … always the first to ask 'what can I do to help', Mr Hinton said.Tributes from police and other emergency services flowed for Brevet Sergeant Doig after the incident, and a life-size silhouette of the officer was erected at Lucindale in his honour in April this year.SA Police will 'carry forward his legacy'SA Police Commissioner Grant Stevens similarly told the court the impact of Brevet Sergeant Doig's death on the policing community was significant and enduring .SA Police Commissioner Grant Stevens says the incident has had a wider community impact. (ABC News: Guido Salazar) The impact of a police officer being killed in the execution of their duty is far-reaching, he said. His name will live on forever and be memorialised as a hero. SA Police will remain united in our commitment to carry forward his legacy with honour and purpose. Defence lawyer Andrew Graham told the court he had attended secure mental health facility James Nash House — where Stimson is being detained — to read the victim impact statements ahead of the hearing.He said that while Stimson had not spoken much since the incident and was limited in his articulation, he had visibly reacted when listening to the statements. After listening he said: 'I won't be forgiven, but I want to tell them I'm sorry', he said. He understands that he's unwell but he still feels responsible for what he did. He often thinks about Brevet Sergeant Doig. Mr Graham said his client had appeared in court in person rather than via video link to try and better acknowledge what was being said to him . He understands that he will be detained for many years, he said.A memorial was erected for Brevet Sergeant Jason Doig in Lucindale earlier this year. (ABC News: Carl Saville)He said Stimson's mother, Lynette Stimson, wanted to convey to the court that her heart broke for the officers, their families and the communities impacted when she learned of the shooting and was distraught and blames herself for what happened.He said Stimson had been diagnosed with schizophrenia since the incident and his recovery had been slow because he had not responded adequately to two different antipsychotic medications.He said a third medication had improved his symptoms.At the April hearing, Justice Sandi McDonald said she found Stimson mentally incompetent on the basis his thinking and judgement were profoundly affected by psychosis .At an earlier hearing, the court had heard Stimson had been diagnosed with a psychotic mental illness which was likely to be schizophrenia .Justice McDonald will formally deliver reasons for her findings on a date to be set.Posted 23h ago23 hours agoTue 15 Jul 2025 at 2:09am, updated 20h ago20 hours agoTue 15 Jul 2025 at 5:11amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)If you need someone to talk to, call:Lifeline on 13 11 14Kids Helpline on 1800 551 800MensLine Australia on 1300 789 978Suicide Call Back Service on 1300 659 467Beyond Blue on 1300 22 46 36Headspace on 1800 650 890QLife on 1800 184 527Top StoriesConvicted killer Bradley Murdoch dies 24 years after Peter Falconio's murderTopic:CrimePhoto shows A man in a pale shirt is held by a serious-looking police officer.Watch what happens when ADF soldiers fire the Carl Gustaf recoilless rifleTopic:Defence ForcesPhoto shows Two soldiers on the ground in camoflauge firing a Carl Gustaf weapon.

Turns out he's in jail Brisbane couple loses $8,000 to an unlicensed tradie who is now in jailBy Lottie TwyfordTopic:Construction and Real Estate IndustryMon 14 JulMonday 14 JulyMon 14 Jul 2025 at 7:36pmTrent Jones and Leanne James never imagined the handyman they hired would end up in jail and leave them high and dry. (ABC News: Nickoles Coleman)abc.net.au/news/ryan-david-walker-jailed-fraud-builder-brisbane/105470276Link copiedShareShare articleWith a newborn baby at home and a mounting list of renovations, hiring a handyman online seemed like a simple choice for Leanne James.Of course, if she had known what was going to happen next, it was one she would never have made.Almost a year on, she and her husband are now $8,000 out-of-pocket, their renovations are incomplete, and the carpenter they hired is in prison after pleading guilty to unrelated fraud charges.The saga has left the couple mired in attempts to get their money back, prompting a warning to would-be renovators.Walker never came back to fix some of the work, including skirting boards which were incorrectly installed. (ABC News: Nickoles Coleman)Inside the couple's suburban Brisbane home, the evidence of 39-year-old Ryan David Walker's unfinished work is obvious.Some of the skirting boards have been installed so poorly doors can't open and close.The work the couple paid for was never completed. (ABC News: Nickoles Coleman)Walker also left random holes drilled in the stairs, a half-completed cupboard, and a demolished wardrobe that was never rebuilt. You feel so hopeless, you know, we spent nearly eight grand [and] it was simple tasks, Ms James said.Saga begins with a cupboardThe couple found Walker on online platform Airtasker. (ABC: Bill Code)Ms James first visited the online platform Airtasker around September last year in search of someone who could build a hidden cupboard under the couple’s stairs.Most of the carpentry companies they had tried had turned down the work because it was too small.So, when Walker responded to their request with a plan they liked and quickly got to work, they were impressed with his professionalism. Ryan David Walker is unlicensed, according to QBCC. (Supplied: Linkedin)One job led to another and before long, the couple agreed to pay a deposit just shy of $8,000 for hanging some doors and building some wardrobes.They claim it was almost immediately after Walker received those funds that he essentially disappeared, leaving a trail of unfinished work in his wake. It's been incredibly frustrating with small children to have a house that's half pulled apart, Mr Jones said. We keep finding nails everywhere. The wardrobe in the couple's child's bedroom was left in an unsafe condition. (Supplied: Leanne James)Frustration sets inStill hopeful that Walker would return to finish the job, Ms James contacted police to report that he had left some of his tools, including a circular saw, in their backyard,When she first spoke to them, she claims an officer told her Walker was a known pest .Ms James has been left feeling like no one can be trusted after the encounter. (ABC News: Nickoles Coleman)Later, she made a formal report about him having taken their money without completing the work.Queensland Police Service (QPS) confirmed they received Ms James's report of fraud and are currently investigating.How to prevent a dodgy home buildPhoto shows Homes on a block in various stages of construction in a new suburban area. Building a home is a huge investment. So when it goes wrong, it can be devastating. Here's what to do to make sure it goes to plan, and the steps you can take when it's all too late.She also went to the Queensland Building and Construction Commission (QBCC) to report what had happened and see what could be done.The QBCC wouldn't confirm how many complaints it had received against Walker when contacted by the ABC.For now, the couple say they've been told by QBCC they aren't covered by a home warranty scheme, because they never received any documentation with a licence number on it or a valid contract.While they wait for a final response from QBCC, they've been told not to touch the unfinished work at their home.QBCC wouldn't confirm confirm whether it had received complaints against Walker beyond what was publicly available. (ABC News: Alkira Reinfrank)In the meantime, Ms James has also reported Walker to the Office of Fair Trading and is exploring legal options.The OFT wouldn't comment on whether it had received any complaints in relation to Walker.Walker was sentenced to jail for fraud in the Brisbane District Court last month. (ABC News: Julie Hornsey)Jail term imposedComplicating their attempts to get their money back is the fact that Walker is currently behind bars – something the couple only discovered while searching online for avenues for recourse.He pleaded guilty to four separate fraud charges in the Brisbane District Court last month, admitting to having used a sub-contractor's licence number to forge a contract, and subsequently accepting more than $100,000 in payments for work he wasn't completing.Walker laid the blame for his offending with his gambling addiction in the Brisbane District Court last month. (Getty Images: scyther5)Walker told the court a gambling addiction had led to his offending, and that he was concerned a jail term would delay his ability to pay his victims back.He also told Judge Michael Burnett he had been gainfully employed while court proceedings had been ongoing.His four-year jail term, imposed on June 20, will be suspended after six months.Smaller jobs targeted by unlicensed operatorsMr Bidwell says the state's builder licensing system is among the most robust in the country. (ABC News: Glen Armstrong)While Master Builders Queensland CEO Paul Bidwell says stories like this are relatively rare, he acknowledged it isn’t unusual to see unlicensed contractors coming out of the woodwork , particularly after natural disasters and offering smaller repairs.Mr Bidwell is concerned these operators are doing damage to the industry's reputation and making it difficult for people to trust tradies. The reality is, when push comes to shove, that people will be convinced to take an easy option, he said. If it sounds too good to be true, then it is too good to be true. Mr Bidwell says natural disasters can entice unlicensed operators out of the woodwork to offer their services. (ABC Gold Coast: Alexandria Utting)'Robust' system in placeQueensland has had a licensing system for trades since 1991, and a licence is required in most cases if the works to be completed are worth more than $3,300.Mr Bidwell described it as one of the most robust in the country, which in theory means no-one should be performing building work without a licence.But he said the onus is on would-be renovators to check the licences of tradespeople. Don't take anything at face value, he said. Have a look at their record through the QBCC ... they can see whether the carpenter has had any directions. There's nothing like getting references from people you know to make sure that the contractor can deliver what they say they can do. CEO of Master Builders Queensland Paul Bidwell warns would-be renovators should be wary of offers which sound too good to be true. (ABC News: Glen Armstrong)A QBCC search of Ryan David Walker reveals he is unlicensed.It also shows he has previously been disqualified and has had infringements issued for unlicensed contracting in the past.The record also reveals he declared bankruptcy in 2024.A spokesperson for QBCC says people should look up tradespeople before they engage their services. (Supplied: QBCC)Warning for would-be renovatorsQBCC declined the ABC's request for an interview. In a statement, a spokesperson said home owners should check the licensee register before engaging a tradesperson. In addition, having a written, dated and signed contract in place isn’t just smart, it’s an essential part of the process and can safeguard you if things go wrong, they said.QBCC said people would generally be covered under their home warranty scheme if they enter into a contract with a licensed tradesperson, although each case is assessed individually.The couple say they will be more wary in the future, but think more education is needed. (ABC News: Nickoles Coleman)As for Ms James and Mr Jones, they're planning on being a lot more wary in the future and will only use tradespeople who've been recommended by their family and friends. I do think there should be some more education on this, Ms James said.The couple hope sharing their story will help others avoid falling into a similar trap.Posted Mon 14 Jul 2025 at 7:36pmMonday 14 Jul 2025 at 7:36pmMon 14 Jul 2025 at 7:36pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesConvicted killer Bradley Murdoch dies 24 years after Peter Falconio's murderTopic:CrimePhoto shows A man in a pale shirt is held by a serious-looking police officer.Watch what happens when ADF soldiers fire the Carl Gustaf recoilless rifleTopic:Defence ForcesPhoto shows Two soldiers on the ground in camoflauge firing a Carl Gustaf weapon.

(Supplied)In short: The trial of a man accused of murdering his father and leaving him dead in his backyard for up to two days has begun in the Supreme Court in Wollongong.Milenko Snjegota, 49, also known as Gobesan, has pleaded not guilty to murdering his father, 74-year-old Vitomir Snjegota, at their Farmborough Heights home in February 2024. What's next? The judge-only trial is expected to run for two weeks. abc.net.au/news/snjegota-on-trial-accused-of-murdering-father/105528610Link copiedShareShare articleAn Illawarra man fatally struck his father over the head, leaving him for dead in the family backyard for up to two days, a Supreme Court trial has heard. Milenko Snjegota, 49, also known as Gobesan, has pleaded not guilty to murdering his 74-year-old father, Vitomir Snjegota, at their Farmborough Heights home west of Wollongong in February last year. Mr G Snjegota, who lives with diagnosed schizophrenia, wore earbuds as Justice Stephen Campbell opened the judge-only Supreme Court trial in Wollongong on Monday.Crown prosecutor Nerissa Keay told the court the victim was a divorced father of two, retired steel worker and Foxtel cable installer who lived in the downstairs portion of a two-storey home he built 50 years ago. The father and son lived at this home in Farmborough Heights. (ABC Illawarra: Tim Fernandez)Ms Keay said the accused had lived upstairs in the same property since his mental health began deteriorating in the late 1990s and was known to be rude to his father . He expressed hostility about being forced to receive mental health treatment, Ms Keay told the court. 'Struck over the head'The court heard Mr V Snjegota was found face up in his backyard covered in a white sheet, with significant blunt-force trauma to his head.Ms Keay said it was the Crown's case that Mr V Snjegota's son struck him over the head at least seven times with an object like a crowbar or hammer . It's the Crown case the accused killed Mr [V] Snjegota while mowing [the lawn] on February 3, and that the violence was more than necessary to kill him, Ms Keay told the court. The victim may have been dead 16 to 48 hours before being taken to the mortuary. The court heard Mr G Snjegota was due to receive an injection for his mental condition the day after his father's body was found. The court heard the victim emigrated from the former Yugoslavia to Australia at 17, married and had two children. (Supplied)Ms Keay told the court the victim's neighbour made the grim discovery on February 4 after noticing waterlogging and leakage from the property. The Crown will allege the accused tried to clean the scene with water, Ms Keay said.The court was also shown police body-worn camera vision and photos of brown leather shoes owned by the accused, which Ms Keay said contained traces of the victim's blood. DNA of the accused was also found on the white sheet covering the victim's body, she told the court. Milenko Snjegota is accused of murdering his father who was found dead in their Wollongong backyard. (ABC Illawarra: Tim Fernandez)However, the court heard no DNA evidence was found on two crowbars located in the family garage. Part of the Crown's case is the crowbars were cleaned with bleach found at the property, Ms Keay said.Defence says evidence circumstantial In his brief opening, defence lawyer Scott Fraser told the court there was only circumstantial evidence linking his client to the alleged murder.Forensic officers examined the scene for evidence earlier in the week. (ABC Illawarra: Tim Fernandez)He said the defence agreed with forensic information provided by the Crown and that the cause of death is not an issue .In regards to the crowbars being cleaned with bleach, Mr Fraser said cleaning had been a significant matter in his client's life, not just in this circumstance .The court heard the accused believed he had been misdiagnosed with schizophrenia and that the judge may have to consider the Cognitive Impairment Provisions Act in this case. Family 'emotionally abused'As the Crown's first witness, the victim's daughter Silvana Gnjegota held back tears as she detailed her brother's long history of mental decline.Silvana Snjegota told the court she spoke to her father on the phone about three days before his death. (Supplied)She told the court during cross-examination, in the years before the alleged murder, Mr G Snjegota was emotionally abusive to her and sent her threatening emails because he disagreed with the methods used to treat his condition. Neighbour Stephen Peck later gave evidence and said the accused would speak to Jesus … play music from his parked car every day … and was always pretty nasty to his father, which is a shame .The trial is expected to run for two weeks.

Robert James Angus. (Facebook: Barry Maney Group)Mr Stevens's 18-year-old son Charlie was hit by a car in Goolwa on the night of November 17, 2023, and died at 7pm the next day in Adelaide.The court heard Angus, a married father of four, sent the email later that night after hearing of Charlie's death in the media. Although comprised of only three words, the defendant's email was an expression of enjoyment and derision towards the commissioner's grief at the loss of his son, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) said in its submission to the court ahead of sentencing.Commissioner deeply offendedMagistrate Koula Kossiavelos said the DPP alleged Angus knew the deliberate timing of this offending would inflict maximum distress . It is submitted that the hypothetical reasonable person would be shocked, outraged and disgusted at your behaviour, she said. More importantly, this is what the commissioner has said in relation to being subjected to your email: he found the offending to be abhorrent, deeply offensive and cruel. In your record of interview, you showed no remorse or understanding of the gravity of your actions to the extent that you queried why police were bothering to investigate it. When asked why you sent the email, you responded, 'Because you could.' The man who hit and killed Charlie left the scene but was arrested that night. (ABC News)The court heard that since his offending, Angus had apologised in a letter to the commissioner and had been diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder and impulsive aggressive disorder.Magistrate Kossiavelos said the conditions contributed to the offending, but were not the cause of it. I find that his moral culpability for the offence is partially reduced, but there is a need for general and personal deterrence, she said.The court heard Angus did not remember sending the email and had not explained why he sent it.Offending 'at higher end'The court heard Angus was undergoing cognitive behaviour therapy and taking medication to stabilise his moods.The truck sales manager's last criminal conviction was in 2008.The maximum penalty for the crime is 12 months in jail and an $18,780 fine if convicted in a magistrate's court.Angus's lawyer pushed for no conviction to be recorded and for her client to be given a good behaviour bond.The Mount Gambier Magistrates Court heard Angus had mental health conditions. (ABC South East SA: Bec Whetham)Magistrate Kossiavelos ordered Angus to do 150 hours of community service within 12 months and to pay prosecution costs of $512. Reasonable persons would all find that what you did on November 18, 2023, was very offensive, she said. It was probably at the higher end of the scale of what offensive can actually be in all the circumstances. The man who hit and killed Charlie was given a suspended sentence last October.ABC South East SA — local news in your inboxGet our local newsletter, delivered free each FridayEmail addressSubscribeYour information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement.Posted Mon 14 Jul 2025 at 6:04amMonday 14 Jul 2025 at 6:04amMon 14 Jul 2025 at 6:04amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesConvicted killer Bradley Murdoch dies 24 years after Peter Falconio's murderTopic:CrimePhoto shows A man in a pale shirt is held by a serious-looking police officer.Watch what happens when ADF soldiers fire the Carl Gustaf recoilless rifleTopic:Defence ForcesPhoto shows Two soldiers on the ground in camoflauge firing a Carl Gustaf weapon.

If you want to get aid and secure food, you have to come through here; otherwise you won't eat. Today, all these people have become gangsters. They seize food from trucks and anything they find on the road. They'll take food away from anyone. If someone grabs food from a truck and I don't get my share, I'll go after him. That's how we have become. If someone gets something, I will take it from him to eat. Some people here die from stabbings and attacks — all over food. We've all turned into mafias and road blockers. Some of the men say they have worked with a gang leader named Yasser Abu Shabab.Some of the gangs looting aid have reportedly been armed and protected by Israeli authorities. (ABC News)'Uncharismatic, illiterate' gang leaderOnce a wanted criminal, it's now widely believed that Abu Shabab has been armed and protected by the Israeli government — to take control of the part of southern Gaza where his family holds sway.Abu Shabab is apparently an unlikely figure to lead a resistance against Hamas's rule in Gaza, Gazan analyst Muhammad Shehada, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in The New Arab. Police in Gaza were perplexed when he emerged as a top gang leader. The security source told The New Arab that Abu Shabab is 35 years old, thin, weak, short [around 150 centimetres tall], uncharismatic, illiterate, has strabismus in one eye, and has never received military training, he said. To them, he didn't seem like someone with the leadership skills necessary to form a group of 300 armed militants, steal truckloads of aid, and store it under the radar. The UN says Yasser Abu Shabab's gang has been raiding aid trucks with the apparent indifference or protection of the Israeli military. (Supplied: Facebook)Israeli media have reported Abu Shabab escaped from jail with Israeli assistance early in the war. He was in a Hamas prison until October 2023 for theft and drug offences, and his release came under the cover of an Israeli attack on security facilities in the Strip at the beginning of the war. From that moment on, his name emerged as someone who would fill the security vacuum in eastern Rafah, the Israeli newspaper Maariv wrote.The United Nations has identified Abu Shabab's gang as one of those raiding aid convoys when they entered Gaza, saying they were doing so with the apparent protection or indifference of the Israeli military.Former French diplomat Jean-Pierre Filliu, who spent one month in Gaza with Doctors Without Borders from December 2024 to January 2025, said he witnessed the gang being protected by the IDF while looting trucks. The Israeli military recognised its inability to promote a clan-based alternative to Hamas and decided to rely more or less openly on organised crime, he wrote in Le Monde. The key figure in this manoeuvre was a previously minor member of a Rafah family, Yasser Abu Shabab, whom Hamas had imprisoned in the past for his various trafficking activities. But Israeli protection allowed Abu Shabab to substantially expand its activities and poach, from other clans, some 100 loyalists ready for anything, often ex-convicts. What could only be called a gang operated under the eyes of the Israeli army … and it was equipped with brand-new weapons, an irrefutable indication of its collaboration with the occupiers. The Netzarim Corridor, where many of the aid gangs lurk, separates northern Gaza from the south and was cleared of buildings by the Israeli military. (Supplied via Reuters: Planet Labs Inc)Gangs taking whatever they canA gang member confirmed to the ABC that Abu Shabab's group had been stealing and selling aid. People would work normally with Yasser just like employees. He had two shifts. It was easy, the gang member said. We used to stand by the roadside to wait for trucks from Gaza to Kerem Shalom. I would take whatever I could — flour, sugar, anything we needed. The man explained that much of the looted food was then sold to merchants, although he insisted aid groups were given some of it. They would unload the goods, and traders would come to buy them. Half of the supplies were distributed to institutions like schools, he said. The aid agency would arrive to collect its share and then distribute it to schools. Abu Shabab's gang call themselves the Anti-Terror Service or the Popular Forces . (ABC News)The gang member alleged Hamas had previously been stealing some aid, something the group denies. He [Yasser] was working in security when he saw the government and Hamas members stealing from the aid trucks as they passed through central Gaza and Nuseirat, he told the ABC. That's when he decided to take action — stealing the trucks to distribute some of the aid himself, handing out money, flour … and that was it. Abu Shabab and his men, now calling themselves the Anti-Terror Service or the Popular Forces , have been accused by many Gazans of working with the Israeli government.The Israeli government has said openly it has backed groups like the one Abu Shabab runs.Hamas fighters have clashed with members of Abu Shabab's gang. (ABC News)Netanyahu arms 'clans' in GazaIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted in June that his government had activated clans in Gaza opposed to Hamas.That sparked concerns from the opposition that their weapons could eventually be turned on the IDF, or used to create unmanageable chaos. In consultation with security officials, we made use of clans in Gaza that are opposed to Hamas, he said in a video on social media. What's wrong with that? It saves the lives of IDF soldiers. The Times of Israel said Defence officials had confirmed Mr Netanyahu was referring to the Abu Shabab gang. The sources confirmed that Israel has been arming the gang with Kalashnikov rifles, including some that were seized from Hamas during the ongoing war, it wrote on June 5.Palestinians guard trucks carrying aid into the north of Gaza from the Israeli-controlled Zikim crossing. (AFP: Bashar Taleb)Former Israeli defence minister Avigdor Lieberman has alleged Abu Shabab had ties to the IS terrorist group. The Israeli government is giving weapons to a group of criminals and felons, identified with Islamic State, at the direction of the prime minister, he told Israeli public radio.The Abu Shabab group was alleged to be providing security for the new, Israeli and US-backed food distribution operation, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.It denied any links with the gang. GHF has no association with Yasser or the 'Anti-Terror Service', it said in a statement sent to the ABC.Grave concerns over Gaza aid planPhoto shows A boy holds up a jar on the back of a truckAs Gazans approach starvation, Israel's government has stopped the United Nations and other agencies from distributing food in Gaza and replaced them with a mysterious new contractor.Hamas fighters have attacked the group, but said Israeli forces came to its defence, Israeli media reported. The arrival of the new aid operation has changed conditions in the south of Gaza, but Hamas is still keen to kill or imprison Abu Shabab again.On July 2, the Hamas-controlled Interior Ministry in Gaza gave Abu Shabab 10 days to surrender himself and face trial for treason.The ABC called and sent messages to Yasser Abu Shabab but did not receive a response.Comment has also been sought from the Israeli government and the IDF.Meanwhile, the Israeli government and military continue to dismiss United Nations reports of a worsening hunger crisis in Gaza.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is only distributing food parcels at limited locations in southern and central Gaza.Israel's government last month stopped allowing food shipments into the north.The men who block the roads are still waiting by the aid routes, hoping for any chance to seize supplies and stay alive.The UN says the hunger crisis in Gaza is worsening.

Vessel now in Fort Lauderdale By David Goodhue July 16, 2025 8:23 PM Paige Bell, a South African national, was found murdered aboard a yacht on which she was a crew member, while it was docked in Eleuthera, Bahamas, July 3, 2025. The Royal Bahamas Police Force arrested her colleague on the ship with her murder. GoFundMe Bahamian authorities have charged the engineer of a luxury yacht with the murder of a crew member colleague who was found stabbed to death in the vessel’s engine room while it was docked in Eleuthera earlier this month.Bahamian police say the woman, 20-year-old Paige Bell, from South Africa, was reported missing for a short period of time before being found dead on the 142-foot yacht, Far From It, while it was in Harbour Island, Eleuthera, on July 3.Charged with her death is 39-year-old Brigido Muños, a Mexican national who also worked on the vessel, according to Our News Bahamas. Per the news outlet, a judge denied Muños’ bond, and his next court appearance is scheduled for Nov. 20. The Royal Bahamas Police Force said that Muños had “severe” wounds to his arms when they found him, and investigators think he tried to kill himself after he killed Bell. According to the ship tracking site MarineTraffic.com, the Far From It is docked at a Fort Lauderdale marina on the New River this week. Representatives from the company that books trips on the yacht could not immediately be reached for comment. Renting the yacht, which has a crew of eight and can accommodate 12 guests in its six cabins, costs between $140,000 and $165,000 a week, depending on the time of year, according to The Luxury Charter Group. It sails to destinations including the the Bahamas, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, the Windward and Leeward Islands and all the way to north to New England, the company says. Bell’s former shipmates from another yacht, the Sweet Emocean, posted on a GoFundMe page set up to financially help her family, that she was going to celebrate her 21st birthday on July 14. “Paige was more than a teammate, she was family. Her radiant spirit, infectious laughter, and boundless compassion made an unforgettable impact on everyone lucky enough to know her. Whether it was long days at sea or quiet moments under the stars, she brought light and warmth wherever she went,” her former colleagues wrote.“In this difficult time, we want to come together to support the people she loved most, her family.” David Goodhue Miami Herald Go to X Go to Facebook Email this person 305-923-9728 David Goodhue covers the Florida Keys and South Florida for FLKeysNews.com and the Miami Herald.

Two men with connections to Florida are at the center of a sweeping federal indictment unsealed last week in Puerto Rico, accused of orchestrating a massive international fraud scheme that stole more than $650 million from cryptocurrency investors around the world.Michael Shannon Sims, 48, of Georgia and Florida, and Juan Carlos Reynoso, 57, of New Jersey and Florida, were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with OmegaPro, an online investment platform that prosecutors say was actually a global pyramid scheme.If convicted, Sims and Reynoso each face up to 20 years in federal prison on each count.Federal authorities say OmegaPro lured thousands of victims from the U.S., Latin America and beyond — including Florida and Puerto Rico — with false promises of extraordinary returns, up to 300% in just 16 months, supposedly through foreign-exchange trading.But prosecutors say there were no elite traders — just a sophisticated scam.“The defendants preyed upon vulnerable individuals in the U.S. and abroad, defrauding them of over $650 million by making false promises of substantial returns and that their money was safe,” said Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.According to the indictment, Sims and Reynoso — along with other co-conspirators — operated the scheme from 2019 to 2023 by selling cryptocurrency-based “investment packages” and claiming the funds would be managed by expert foreign-exchange traders. Instead, investigators say the money was funneled into crypto wallets controlled by OmegaPro insiders, who then laundered and concealed the funds. Both Sims and Reynoso allegedly pocketed millions.Sims is identified as a founder, consultant, and top promoter of OmegaPro, while Reynoso allegedly ran operations across Latin America and parts of the U.S., including South Florida and Puerto Rico.To build credibility, prosecutors say Sims boasted of OmegaPro’s trading prowess and promoted its so-called “elite” traders. Reynoso is accused of assuring investors that OmegaPro was fully licensed — or alternatively, that it didn’t fall under any country’s regulations.They also went to great lengths to project an image of success, hosting extravagant events around the globe, including one in Dubai, where the OmegaPro logo was splashed across the famed Burj Khalifa skyscraper. On social media, they flaunted luxury lifestyles — high-end cars, designer watches, private jets — all allegedly paid for with investor money.By January 2023, the operation began to unravel. OmegaPro claimed it had suffered a “network hack,” sparking panic among investors. Reynoso and others promised the funds would be transferred to a new platform, Broker Group — but victims say their money was never returned.“This case exposes the ruthless reality of modern financial crime,” said Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Chief Guy Ficco. “OmegaPro promised financial freedom but delivered financial ruin — stealing over $650 million from everyday people and vanishing it into virtual currency.” Antonio Maria Delgado el Nuevo Herald Go to X Go to Facebook Email this person 305-376-2180 Galardonado periodista con más de 30 años de experiencia, especializado en la cobertura de temas sobre Venezuela.

Getty Images A therapist at a mental health and substance abuse treatment facility for women in Miami has been arrested on charges of sexually abusing at least two patients who were under his care. Miami Police say a woman in her 40s reported that Manuel Enrique Garcia, 33, began to touch her inappropriately during a one-on-one session and sexually assaulted her. Afterwards, he told her not to report what had occurred, warning her he could lose his job and she could be discharged and return to being homeless.The woman had been admitted to the facility in February during a “vulnerable depressive episode,” according to police. The assault happened sometime between February and March, she told detectives.According to Garcia’s arrest affidavit, a second victim, a woman in her 20s, told police that approximately two weeks before his Tuesday arrest, he approached her, offered her candy and asked if she needed anything from her personal belongings, which were stored in his office. Once inside, she says he pulled her into the room, kissed her and touched her inappropriately. The woman told investigators that the defendant then made a sexually explicit proposition.She feared retaliation and that Garcia might “document negative remarks in her therapy progress notes, which could potentially harm her standing in court, prevent her from being discharged from the facility, or even delay her reunification with her child,” his arrest affidavit read.A second alleged incident occurred roughly a week later. While she was in Garcia’s office making a phone call, she claims he exposed himself and initiated another coerced sexual act. She also reported that he used his cellphone to record part of the encounter.The woman told detectives that she was paralyzed by fear, particularly given the therapist’s prior knowledge of her trauma history—information she had disclosed in confidence during therapy sessions.Police say several women corroborated the victims’ accounts.Garcia was arrested on Tuesday at 4850 NE Second Ave. per his arrest affidavit. The address matches that of Concept House, a rehabilitation center specializing in addiction treatment. He has been charged with three felony counts of a psychotherapist engaging in sex with a client.He remained in custody at Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center as of Wednesday morning.Detectives encourage anyone with additional information or experiences to contact the Miami Police Department Special Victims Unit at 305-603-6300 or 305-579-6111.

Judkins, 21, was arrested at the Four Seasons Hotel, 525 N Fort Lauderdale Beach Blvd, per a police report.The victim told investigators she waited to report the incident because “she felt bad due to [Judkins’] recent success and career” but changed her mind after speaking with her loved ones. Judkins and his ex-girlfriend had split in December but were rekindling their relationship at the time of the incident, the report shows.READ MORE: Cleveland Browns rookie cuffed after domestic violence incident in Broward: copsJudkins, who faces a misdemeanor domestic battery charge, bonded out of the Broward Main Jail on Sunday. The Miami Herald reached out to his attorney David Weinstein but hasn’t received a response as of Monday afternoon.Judkins’ ex-girlfriend told investigators that their spat began at the baggage claim of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, when Judkins got frustrated after reading messages from family members. The nature of the messages wasn’t mention in the police report.However, their argument escalated when they entered a Lamborghini SUV. Judkins’ ex, according to the report, told him the messages weren’t true, then Judkins punched her in the mouth.Officers noted in the report that she had visible bruising on her chin — and photographs of her injuries.At one point, the victim got out of the SUV and called Judkins’ mother, although she didn’t tell her what had transpired, the report says. She got back inside, and the squabble over the messages continued. Judkins then hit his ex-girlfriend several times while driving, according to the report. She had visible bruises on her arm and thigh — and photos of her injuries, officers noted.She told police she began to kick her feet at Judkins to defend herself, the report says. Shortly after, Judkins pulled into a Burger King parking lot, where his ex told him, “Don’t touch me again.”It’s unclear from the police report what happened in the five days before she reported the incident.Judkins was selected in the second round with the 36th overall pick in the 2025 NFL draft by the Browns after having played for the Ohio State Buckeyes. In 2022, he was named SEC Freshman of the Year when he was a second-string running back for the University of Mississippi Rebels.

Police won’t talk By Grethel Aguila and Charles Rabin July 10, 2025 5:40 PM More than a month after a Miami-Dade judge signed an arrest warrant for former NFL star Antonio Brown, saying he tried to shoot someone outside a celebrity boxing event in Little Haiti, the former all pro has not been taken into custody. Miami Police are not saying what they’re doing to bring him back. Jason Getz Jason Getz-USA TODAY Sports A month after being charged with attempted murder, former NFL star Antonio Brown has posted videos on social media flaunting his lavish lifestyle abroad — riding around in expensive cars and sauntering on a yacht overlooking Dubai’s skyscrapers.It’s almost as if Brown, 37, were taunting police. But Miami Police will not say whether they consider Brown on the run — or if they’re working to bring him back to the U.S. to face trial.A Miami-Dade judge signed off on Brown’s arrest warrant a month ago. But police don’t appear to be looking for him and refuse to discuss the case. There’s also no record or court date for Brown in the database of Miami-Dade circuit court records.READ MORE: Antonio Brown charged with attempted murder after shooting at Miami boxing eventIn a video uploaded to X on Thursday, Brown is seen celebrating his birthday in a red Ferrari 812 GTS and hanging out with his young sons on the water.

After the shooting, Brown said on social media that he was attacked by people trying to steal his jewelry.

The jewelry designer spent a month in jail in the United Arab Emirates, documents show, before proving that Brown lied.READ MORE: Antonio Brown’s false accusations put Miami jeweler in Dubai jail for month: lawsuitPeople accused of crimes usually negotiate with authorities to surrender upon their return. Brown had an attorney early on who secured him a $10,000 bond, including house arrest. As of Thursday, it’s unclear if Brown was being represented by an attorney. Another unknown: whether prosecutors will continue to honor the bond agreement in place. Brown could be detained by the FBI or U.S. Marshals if Miami Police or the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office request that the federal agencies issue a warrant for Brown’s return, said Jeffrey Sloman, a Miami criminal defense attorney who served briefly as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. This is usually accomplished through a federal charge brought forward if a person is avoiding prosecution. If a person remains a fugitive, they may not be granted bond to get out of jail, or a judge could be more harsh in their confinement, Sloman said. The attorney said to look no further than his client Ohad Fisherman, who was on his honeymoon in Japan but returned quickly to address the criminal charge against him. Fisherman — who was entangled in one of the cases brought by the state against the Alexander brothers — had a sex crime charge against him dropped on Monday by state prosecutors.READ MORE: Alexander brothers’ friend cleared in sex case — tearful, angry at state prosecutors“It’s in [Brown’s] best interest to come back immediately, so hopefully the judge would give him a reasonable bond so he can fight the charges out of jail,” Sloman said. “It’s very difficult to fight a case in jail. If Mr. Brown continues to avoid prosecution, eventually he will travel somewhere or to some place and he will be arrested.”Padilla told the Herald police likely believe that Brown will return to South Florida because he has property and children in the area. Formally extraditing Brown, he said, would be costly.

Daniel A. Varela dvarela@miamiherald.com “It’s not easy for the FBI to be dragging people from the Middle East,” Padilla said. “There’ll be a point that if this continues, it could manifest into something larger.”Brown should contact an attorney to turn himself in, Padilla said, because a judge could factor in the amount of time he was abroad after the warrant was signed when deciding his bond. “This is a serious crime. This isn’t going to go away,” Padilla said. “...He’s going to have to face these charges.” Grethel Aguila Miami Herald Go to X Email this person Grethel covers courts and the criminal justice system for the Miami Herald.

Appeals judges have now reduced his sentence from 18 to 13 years.https://p.dw.com/p/4xSWKJudges at the Hague in the 2024 ruling said the torture perpetrated by Shala was of particular cruelty. Image: Piroschka van de Wouw/Pool/AP/picture alliance AdvertisementKosovo Liberation Army (KLA) member Pjeter Shala saw his conviction upheld but the sentence reduced from 18 to 13 years, the Kosovo Specialist Chambers tribunal in The Hague said on Monday. The tribunal, staffed by international judges and lawyers, was set up in 2015 to handle cases under Kosovo law against fighters of the KLA. The court said Shala's original sentencing was out of reasonable proportion to comparable cases. Shala was convicted in 2024 of war crimes during the during the 1998-99 Kosovo uprising against Serbian troops. He was found guilty of torture, murder and arbitrary detention, which he committed as he ran a makeshift prison where people considered to be spies or collaborators with Serbs were housed. What did appeals judges say? The original Hague tribunal conviction was appealed, with judges reversing several convictions for torture and arbitrary detention in relation to some victims, but confirming convictions for the same war crimes involving other victims. Judges also determined that the previous conviction had not taken into account that Shala was not in a commanding role for the murder charge. In the end, judges reduced his sentence from 18 to 13 years. The reduction in his sentence in no way suggests that the crimes for which he has been convicted and sentenced are not grave, judge Kai Ambos told the court. Shala exhibited 'particular cruelty' Shala followed the hearing by video link, dressed in a light blue shirt and tie. As the decision was read out, he shook his head and appeared to be speaking but his words were not broadcast. Victims under Shala were beaten with batons and baseball bats, forced to hit each other, burned with cigarettes, coerced to simulate sexual acts with each other, and in some cases shot. Judges at the earlier trial said the torture perpetrated by Shala was of particular cruelty and the victims were particularly vulnerable and defenseless. The victims were largely ethnic Albanians accused by the KLA of collaboration with Serbian forces. More than 13,000 people are believed to have died during the 1998-99 Kosovo uprising against Serbian troops, led by then-president Slobodan Milosevic.

Here's how the death cap became the center of a chilling murder case. https://p.dw.com/p/4x8P8Even small amounts of death cap mushrooms are lethal if consumed.Image: Hans Reinhard/Okapia/picture-allianceAdvertisementA jury in Australia has found Erin Patterson guilty on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder. The murder weapon: Toxic mushrooms. Prosecutors argued Patterson intentionally served four of her family members with meal portions containing toxic death cap mushrooms in 2023. Patterson denied being guilty, originally telling police she had used store-bought mushrooms from a supermarket, then an Asian grocer in Melbourne. A search of such stores found no evidence that poisonous mushrooms had ever been sold. During the trial, Patterson said she may have foraged for the mushrooms but could not say for certain where she had obtained the death caps. Why are death cap mushrooms so deadly? Deadly by name and by nature, death cap mushrooms (Amanita phalloides) are full of a highly stable toxin called alpha-Amanitin. The toxin is so stable that it won't break down when exposed to heat in cooking. When a death cap is eaten, people don’t usually feel symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea until at least 6 hours later. During this time the alpha-Amanitin toxins are making their way through the bloodstream into organs of the body. The toxin primarily acts in the liver, where it causes cells in the liver to die. Alpha-Amanitin binds with RNA polymerase-II enzymes, preventing the cells from creating new proteins. Eventually, the liver starts to shut down. Death can occur within 24 hours. Careful identification required The Amanita genus of fungi is well-known for their toxic properties. This group include the fairytale toadstool commonly known as the fly agaric, death caps, and destroying angels . But some other Amanita mushrooms are edible. Most cases of death cap poisoning are often a case of misidentification — their classic white appearance and domed cap looks like many other types of fungi. Identification of mushrooms requires a knowledge of different parts of the anatomy: the cap or fruiting body, the gills or spores beneath the cap, and the stipe — or stalk. While death caps look like many other mushrooms, one defining characteristic is their bad smell. They don't store well at all, unless you dehydrate them. They quickly go very stinky and very nasty, Brett Summerell, a fungi expert and Chief Scientist at the Botanic Gardens of Sydney, Australia, told DW. Because of the risk of misidentification by amateurs, it's usually recommended that foragers go for edible species that cannot be mistaken. Of course, foraging under the supervision of a trained mycologist — a fungi scientist — is usually a safe option. The famous red and white toadstool is a member of the Amanita genus, and a cousin of other deadly mushroom species.Image: FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP No death caps in the supermarket The jury ultimately didn’t find Patterson’s defense — that she mixed up foraged mushrooms in the same container as store-bought ones — believable. The prosecution argued Patterson knowingly put the toxic mushrooms in the home-cooked lunch and disposed of evidence. Summerell said the likelihood that death caps could get into store-bought products is, to be honest, farcical. The reason? Death caps only grow next to oak and beech trees. Death caps, like many fungi, are mycorrhizal, meaning they have a symbiotic relationship with the tree species. Death caps obtain their nutrients from nearby tree roots and return nutrients to the nearby soil. But because they can only grow at the base of oak and beech trees, it means there's no chance of them sprouting in a commercial setting, where spores are cultivated in highly controlled conditions — and with no trees in sight. Australia could get rid of death caps Death caps aren’t native to Australia, and neither are the oak and beech trees that support them. The trees were first introduced into Australia from Europe in the 19th ecntury, and death caps in the 1960s. Summerell and other mycologists are now discussing the possibility of removing oak trees in some parts of Australia. We have argued that, in Sydney, if it's at all possible, we should start to think about removing oak trees from some of these suburbs just from the point of view of a public health risk, said Summerell. Removing introduced oaks could harbor positive benefits, both from a public health perspective by removing the risk of the top cause of mushroom poisoning, as well as providing more space for native Australian plant life.

But some criminologists doubt the figures.https://p.dw.com/p/4wuVjShoplifting is on the rise, say retailersImage: Carsten Milbret/imageBROKER/picture allianceAdvertisementGermany has never had more shoplifters than in 2024. An annual survey of 98 retailers estimates a 3% increase on the year before — amounting to some €4.95 billion ($5.84 billion) in losses. The latest study by Germany's Retail Institute (EHI) on inventory differences shows that the vast majority of those losses (€4.2 billion) was down to theft from customers, employees, or delivery workers, the EHI said, which would mean losses of some €570 million to the public purse through lost sales tax. The EHI also said that retailers had to resort to balancing out their losses and the costs of extra security by increasing prices. Study author Frank Horst calculated that some 1.5% of prices in stores could now be attributed to covering theft and security. Shoplifting techniques The EHI said there had also been a 5% increase in organized shoplifting, which accounted for a third of the total shoplifting losses. Horst said this could be individual thieves working their way through a shopping list, or else, the thefts could be carried out by coordinated groups. One of them drives a vehicle, one of them distracts the staff, or shields the one putting the goods away so they can't be seen, Horst told DW. Sometimes so-called depots are set up in the store, where all the goods are packed in a bag, and then someone else carries it out in a surreptitious moment. The survey does not include exact breakdowns of the kinds of articles that get stolen, but Horst says that thieves often target anything small, expensive, and that can be easily re-sold, such as perfume and cosmetics. There had also been a rise in the theft of foods, especially relatively expensive things like meats and cheeses. But Nicole Bögelein, a criminologist at Cologne University, cast doubt on how useful the study actually is. She told DW that the researchers estimate that 98% of cases aren't even discovered. So it's just an assumption that the majority of these losses can be attributed to theft, she said. Bögelein also cast doubt on the EHI's conclusion that there are more organized shoplifting gangs, as that could simply be because store detectives are more on the lookout for such groups. 'Poverty crimes' Despite its shortcomings, the annual EHI survey is one of the few shoplifting studies there are, and it is focused mostly on the economic impact. Bögelein, by training a sociologist as well as a criminologist, has a different perspective and says that almost all cases of shoplifting are so-called poverty crimes — defined as crimes that don't cost any money to carry out, and are committed by people because they have no money. Bögelein's own investigations into shoplifting have found that the people who are caught are often poor — possibly, she says, also because store detectives are more likely to keep an eye on people who look poor. Official statistics suggest that the majority of thefts from shops are relatively petty. According to German federal police statistics, in 66.7% of discovered and prosecuted thefts, the value of the items stolen was under €50 and in 40.2% of cases even under €15. The punishment is usually a small fine, or, if the fine can't or won't be paid, a prison sentence. Germany a 'paradise' for shoplifters? Horst described Germany as a paradise for shoplifters, as the punishments are often relatively mild. Though theoretically thieves can be imprisoned for up to five years, he said that in practice first-time offenders are often not charged at all. Bögelein said that deterrence might have an effect on some minor thefts, but was generally skeptical of the idea that more punishment discourages petty crime. People don't not steal because they're scared of punishment, she argued. In criminology, we find that people stick to rules because they think those rules are correct and because they fear a bad conscience if they don't stick to them. Public transport operators in Germany often charge people a fee for riding without a ticket, but may also press charges, especially for repeat offenders.Image: picture-alliance/dpa/J. Wolf Should shoplifting be decriminalized in Germany? There has been a debate among German criminologists about to what extent poverty crimes should be decriminalized altogether, on the grounds that such crimes are usually victimless and therefore don't require criminal justice. There have long been calls to downgrade one classic poverty crime — riding public transport without a ticket — to a misdemeanor, partly because punishing it has become a burden to public coffers and is clogging up the justice system. Between 8,000 and 9,000 people end up in prison in Germany every year for riding without a ticket. But Horst argued that shoplifting shouldn't always be defined as a poverty crime: The EHI estimates that two-thirds of shoplifting cases were what he called opportunistic perpetrators, and many of them are not necessarily poor. Horst does think that inflation and higher prices for basic items may be playing a role in the rise of shoplifting, but he was reluctant to accept that poverty was the driving element of all theft. It could be a protest theft, because people are saying they're not prepared to accept the price rises for a particular product, he said, I'm sure poverty is a part of it, but that it explains the rise on its own — I don't see that.

But some criminologists doubt the figures.https://p.dw.com/p/4wuVjShoplifting is on the rise, say retailersImage: Carsten Milbret/imageBROKER/picture allianceAdvertisementGermany has never had more shoplifters than in 2024. An annual survey of 98 retailers estimates a 3% increase on the year before — amounting to some €4.95 billion ($5.84 billion) in losses. The latest study by Germany's Retail Institute (EHI) on inventory differences shows that the vast majority of those losses (€4.2 billion) was down to theft from customers, employees, or delivery workers, the EHI said, which would mean losses of some €570 million to the public purse through lost sales tax. The EHI also said that retailers had to resort to balancing out their losses and the costs of extra security by increasing prices. Study author Frank Horst calculated that some 1.5% of prices in stores could now be attributed to covering theft and security. Shoplifting techniques The EHI said there had also been a 5% increase in organized shoplifting, which accounted for a third of the total shoplifting losses. Horst said this could be individual thieves working their way through a shopping list, or else, the thefts could be carried out by coordinated groups. One of them drives a vehicle, one of them distracts the staff, or shields the one putting the goods away so they can't be seen, Horst told DW. Sometimes so-called depots are set up in the store, where all the goods are packed in a bag, and then someone else carries it out in a surreptitious moment. The survey does not include exact breakdowns of the kinds of articles that get stolen, but Horst says that thieves often target anything small, expensive, and that can be easily re-sold, such as perfume and cosmetics. There had also been a rise in the theft of foods, especially relatively expensive things like meats and cheeses. But Nicole Bögelein, a criminologist at Cologne University, cast doubt on how useful the study actually is. She told DW that the researchers estimate that 98% of cases aren't even discovered. So it's just an assumption that the majority of these losses can be attributed to theft, she said. Bögelein also cast doubt on the EHI's conclusion that there are more organized shoplifting gangs, as that could simply be because store detectives are more on the lookout for such groups. 'Poverty crimes' Despite its shortcomings, the annual EHI survey is one of the few shoplifting studies there are, and it is focused mostly on the economic impact. Bögelein, by training a sociologist as well as a criminologist, has a different perspective and says that almost all cases of shoplifting are so-called poverty crimes — defined as crimes that don't cost any money to carry out, and are committed by people because they have no money. Bögelein's own investigations into shoplifting have found that the people who are caught are often poor — possibly, she says, also because store detectives are more likely to keep an eye on people who look poor. Official statistics suggest that the majority of thefts from shops are relatively petty. According to German federal police statistics, in 66.7% of discovered and prosecuted thefts, the value of the items stolen was under €50 and in 40.2% of cases even under €15. The punishment is usually a small fine, or, if the fine can't or won't be paid, a prison sentence. Germany a 'paradise' for shoplifters?

Why is there a market for her content in the Balkan country and how are some Bulgarians fighting it?https://p.dw.com/p/4vrvKOn her social media profiles, Bulgarian influencer Zornitsa Gyutsova posts misogynistic advice about how men should 'deal with' womenImage: Zgyutsova/TikTokAdvertisement Women love men who can be violent if need be. That's why they like men who hit them, Bulgarian influencer Zornitsa Gyutsova tells her followers. Gyutsova suggests that not only do women prefer men who physically assault them, but that this is also the way men should behave because a woman should respect a man's physical power since she is unable to comprehend his intellectual power. This is the kind of advice that can be found on Gyutsova's social media profiles and in a private group founded by her on Telegram called Upstanding Man. 'Equality is contrary to human nature' Zornitsa Gyutsova offers her followers private chats over video where she teaches them how to deal with women — for a fee, of course. Many influencers, life coaches and other online personalities in Bulgaria and elsewhere offer private sessions or courses. What makes Gyutsova's content stand out from the rest is that its sole purpose is to explain to men that they need to learn to control their partners both psychologically and, if necessary, physically.There have been numerous protests against violence against women in Bulgaria in recent years, such as this one in 2023Image: Alexandar Detev/DW In Gyutsova's view, men in general have been treated badly by women, and women are the ones who exert violence on men, namely by not paying them enough respect. The idea of equality is like a worm in people's brains that insists men and women should be partners […] which is so contrary to human nature that it can never work, Gyutsova declared in a long video about her work that was broadcast on Bulgarian National Television. Although the broadcaster, which is partly financed by taxpayer's money, has since removed the video from its platforms, it has never publicly commented on the case. Huge backlash Gyutsova's profiles on social media have been gaining traction for several years now. Screenshots and videos from her private Telegram group chat recently surfaced on social media, triggering a huge backlash in Bulgaria. Local woman Petya Krasteva was so appalled by Gyutsova's online content that she filed a complaint against Gyutsova with the prosecutor's office. On her social media channels, she not only encourages people to degrade women and use violence against them, she also boasts that she uses the same methods on her child and her cat, she told DW. I thought to myself: This is not only absolutely unacceptable, it's criminal. Gender discrimination not a crime in Bulgaria Many other women did the same as Krasteva, only to find out a couple of weeks later that their efforts had been in vain.Petya Krasteva was appalled by Zornitsa Gyutsova's online content and filed a complaint against her with the prosecutor's officeImage: Nikola Gyulmezov In an official reply, the prosecutor's office stated that nothing could be done because Bulgaria's criminal code does not define gender discrimination as a crime and that the issue was a matter for the Commission against Discrimination. Krasteva promptly lodged a complaint with this commission, but received another negative answer based on the same reasoning. Profiles briefly taken down Although these complaints did not lead to charges being brought against Gyutsova, the backlash did have an impact. The outcry and the fact that Gyutsova's social media accounts were reported by people who found their content abhorrent, meant that the influencer's TikTok and Instagram profiles were deactivated. They were, however, reactivated a short time later. Impunity for abusers Krasteva feels that part of the reason why content like Gyutsova's strikes a chord in Bulgaria is that while patriarchal norms and domestic violence are not accepted in the country, Bulgarian society often turns a blind eye to them. The other huge problem, she says, is that as with many other social issues, there is a complete lack of consequences for the perpetrators. Valentina Dimitrova, a psychologist who works for the Emprove Foundation, a Bulgarian organization that supports women who have suffered domestic violence, holds a similar view.Psychologist Valentina Dimitrova says that content like Gyutsova's is dangerous because 'it can truly cost a human life'Image: Venera Velkovska Sadly it's embedded in the Bulgarian mindset that we often just accept that things are bad and we do nothing about it, says Dimitrova. She believes that this is also why many women stay in violent relationships: They simply have no faith in the authorities because time and time again, men who beat or even kill their partners face no legal consequences. Although some people seem to think that social media content is less problematic than actual abuse in real life, Dimitrova stresses the dangers associated with such content: It can truly cost a human life. A global online problem Misogynistic online content that paints women as lesser human beings and men as oppressed by women is not unique to Bulgaria. Such content has been growing and spreading all over the world in recent years. Influencers like Andrew Tate, who faces charges of rape, bodily harm, human trafficking and more, have created a whole movement around this sort of content. Gyutsova fits neatly into this category of influencer, but what makes her different is that she is a woman. What role does feminism play? Dimitrova thinks one issue here is that feminism is often misunderstood. Feminism does not entail men being suppressed and women controlling them. It means that women can have equal rights and can function as equals to men not only in society but also in their personal relationships, she says. Dimitrova also believes that the patriarchal notion that men should not be allowed to express emotions is highly problematic. This is reflected in Gyutsova's content, which suggests that men are weak and not manly if they dare to express their fears, emotions or feelings.People in Sofia attend a protest against domestic violence and violence against women in Bulgaria in 2023 after a young woman was stabbed by her ex-partner Image: Alexandar Detev/DW It's a vicious circle: Men who are not allowed to express any sort of emotion for fear of being labeled weak don't know what to do when they experience something frustrating in their relationships and so they resort to aggression, says Dimitrova. What can be done? Dimitrova suggests that first and foremost, men should receive support and their concerns should not just be swept under the carpet. She stresses, however, that this support should not validate the inclination to deal with problems by exerting psychological or physical violence on women. Although the Emprove Foundation focuses primarily on women's rights and issues, it does have a project that focuses on men's mental health — something the foundation says is incredibly important in the fight against gender-based violence. Men should be encouraged to connect to a healthy understanding of themselves, so they can build healthy relationships as well, says Dimitrova. Petya Krasteva firmly believes that even though authorities in Bulgaria rarely provide the support needed in cases like this, society should not remain indifferent. We should be as loud as possible when something like this turns up, she says. We should be perfectly clear that it is unacceptable.

Why did an Argentinian court ordered an international warrant for her arrest?https://p.dw.com/p/4uJX3Aung San Suu Kyi has been imprisoned by the Myanmar military since 2021 (archive picture from 2012)Image: Loviny Christophe/ABACA/picture alliance AdvertisementIt is rare for an international arrest warrant to be issued against a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and political prisoner whose release is demanded by both the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council. However, this is precisely what occurred in February this year, when an Argentinian court asked for the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi. The court's decision applies to 25 Myanmar citizens wanted on charges linked to genocide and crimes against humanity. The list includes not only Myanmar's military leader Min Aung Hlaing, but also former State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and former President Htin Kyaw. Suu Kyi effectively served as Myanmar's top civilian leader before the military staged a coup in February 2021. She has been imprisoned ever since. The court in Argentina claims it has the jurisdiction to order a warrant for Suu Kyi's arrest based on a legal principle that some serious crimes can be prosecuted regardless of where they were committed. The specific case focuses on discrimination against Myanmar's Rohingya ethnic minority. The Muslim Rohingya live predominantly in the western state of Rakhine, and their status as citizens and as an ethnic group recognized by the state of Myanmar has been disputed for decades. The Rohingya crisis of 2017 Since 1988, Myanmar has seen an ongoing political conflict between the military and military-backed parties on one side and Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, on the other. In 2016, after many years of stalemate, the military and Aung San Suu Kyi reached a truce. A kind of dual government was established, with Aung San Suu Kyi heading the civilian branch and Min Aung Hlaing heading the military, which had constitutionally secured independence and far-reaching political rights. On October 9, 2016, Rohingya insurgents attacked several border and police posts of the Myanmar security forces. In August 2017, the security forces launched so-called clearance operations. As a result, thousands of Rohingya were killed and around 700,000 fled to neighboring Bangladesh, with exact figures still unclear due to the nature of the ethnically-charged conflict. Rohingya refugees fear increased hardship due to aid cutsTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video While the military denied using excessive force, international watchdogs and the UN agree that Myanmar's actions against the Rohingya constitute grave human rights violations. Still, two questions remain: First, did the offensive amount to genocide? Second, how much of it was the responsibility of Aung San Suu Kyi? The question of genocide Concerns that a genocide was happening in Myanmar have already been voiced before 2017. In 2015, the human rights organization Fortify Rights published a report with the Allard K. Lovenstein International Human Rights Clinic from Yale Law School in which was stated that there is strong evidence that genocide is being committed against Rohingya. Those voices only grew louder after 2017, and in November 2019, Gambia initiated a case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Myanmar, claiming violations of the UN's Genocide Convention. The ICJ has yet to rule on the case, however, meaning that the existence of genocide remains unconfirmed in a legal sense. But for human rights organizations like Fortify Rights, the Burmese-Rohingya Organization UK (BROUK) and the former UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar, Tomas Ojea Quintana, there is no doubt that genocide did take place. Quintana, an Argentinian, told Radio Free Asia that the court in his native country understood what was at stake, which is the genocide against the Rohingya people. The question of responsibility Aung San Suu Kyi was a globally renowned human rights advocate since the early 1990s until the events of 2017. She was also heading Myanmar's civilian government during the deadly wave of violence against the Rohingya. As chief councilor, she was notably hesitant to speak out against the military and even went to The Hague in 2019 to defend Myanmar at the International Court of Justice. She denied genocide was happening in Rakhine but admitted human rights violations, which would be investigated by Myanmar. She later confirmed this position in an interview with the Financial Times. War crimes were committed during the internal armed conflict with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army by members of Myanmar's security forces and civilians, she told the paper. At the same time, Aung San Suu Kyi pointed to a report by the Independent Commission of Enquiry (ICOE) which was set up by Myanmar without Rohingya representatives. The ICOE found no evidence of genocide, she told the paper, despite its report recording killing of civilians, disproportionate use of force, looting of property, and destruction of abandoned homes of Muslims. For those who believe Myanmar troops committed genocide against the Rohingya, Aung San Suu Kyi's refusal to recognize it makes her complicit. But does her stance — admitting that human rights violations happened but not genocide — mean Aung San Suu Kyi is guilty of committing genocide? What do we know about the Argentinian court order? The reasons behind the Argentinian court's decision to seek an international arrest warrant are not fully clear, as neither the ruling nor the exact evidence on which the ruling was based are publicly available. DW contacted the Argentinian court and the Argentinian human rights commission to get more information in the matter, but received no reply. The 2021 coup triggered protests in Myanmar, which eventually escalated into a civil war.Image: Sai Aung Main/AFP In the months following the announcement, Myanmar expert and former ambassador Derek Tonkin published an academic paper on the issue, examining the sources which most likely led to the arrest warrant. He writes that the petition [on which the decision of the court seems to be based] contains much narrative and opinion which are debatable and questionable, and in some areas are simply wrong. Commenting on the claim that Aung San Suu Kyi and others validated the genocide against the Rohingya, Tonkin states, it is not true and is supported by no evidence anywhere in the petition. Tonkin also rejects the accusation that Aung San Suu Kyi was directly responsible for the events in Rakhine State during her time as state counsellor at the time. I find this totally unconvincing. The Tatmadaw [the Myanmar military] refused to accept Aung San Suu Kyi's appointment, he writes. So far, the arrest warrant hasn't had any impact. Aung San Suu Kyi seems set to celebrate her 80th birthday next month as a prisoner in Myanmar as the civil war rages on. With the passage of time, the international arrest warrant might end up as a mere footnote in a long political career filled with legal battles.

La noticia se conoce después de que la jueza de instrucción procesara a Amador, el paso previo a que se siente en el banquillo. Esta petición no excluye la posibilidad de que la pareja de Ayuso pacte una pena menor a cambio de reconocer su culpa, un acuerdo que será posible siempre que se cierre antes del juicio. La petición de pena da por primera vez una idea de cómo valora el Ministerio Público la gravedad de los hechos. Amador, dueño de dos consultoras de sellos de calidad, usó 15 facturas consideradas falsas por Hacienda y confeccionadas por tres supuestos cómplices, con el fin de pagar menos en los impuestos de sociedades de 2020 y 2021, cuando sus ingresos crecieron considerablemente. El valor de esas facturas ascendía a 1,7 millones de euros y las incluyó para deducir indebidamente esos ingresos, según la inspección que le hizo la Agencia Tributaria. Por ello, se enfrenta a una posible condena de dos delitos de fraude fiscal del 305 del Código Penal, castigados cada uno de ellos con penas de entre uno y cinco años, en concurso con un delito de falsificación en documento mercantil del 392 del Código Penal, con penas de entre seis meses y tres años. En concreto, la Fiscalía pide un año y nueve meses por el fraude fiscal en el ejercicio 2020 del impuesto de sociedades, cuando Hacienda apreció que la cuota defraudada ascendía a 155.000 euros; y dos años y un día por el ejercicio 2021, cuando esa cuantía fue superior y llegó a 195.951 euros. El escrito pide como atenuante que se considere reparado el daño, ya que el empresario ha ingresado ya la cantidad defraudada. La Fiscalía y Amador habían negociado un pacto en junio del año pasado por el que la pareja de Ayuso reconocía su culpa y aceptaba ocho meses de prisión. Este tipo de acuerdos de conformidad suelen permitir a los reos eludir el ingreso en prisión, siempre y cuando el juez así lo acuerde y no existan antecedentes penales. Aquel acuerdo fue papel mojado porque el día que lo llevaban al juzgado, las acusaciones populares de PSOE y Más Madrid objetaron y avisaron a la jueza de que el empresario debía ser investigado por otros delitos. La magistrada aceptó esa petición y finalmente abrió una pieza separada por los negocios de Amador con el grupo sanitario Quirónsalud. La noticia sobre el escrito de acusación de la Fiscalía ha sido adelantada al final de la tarde por OK Diario, un digital que informa de una petición de seis años de cárcel. El jefe de gabinete de Ayuso, Miguel Ángel Rodríguez, ha comentado de inmediato esa noticia en la red X, insinuando que el presidente del Gobierno está detrás de la petición de la Fiscalía. Sánchez, a la desesperada: el fiscal pide 6 años de cárcel a González Amador pero el que terminará en la cárcel es el fiscal General del Estado. Y ella… La de las saunas… Van tós pá’lante, se pongan como se pongan . Sánchez, a la desesperada: el fiscal pide 6 años de cárcel a González Amador pero el que terminará en la cárcel es el fiscal General del Estado. Y ella… La de las saunas… Van tós pá'lante, se pongan como se pongan La magistrada del juzgado de instrucción 19 de Madrid, María Inmaculada Iglesias, procesó a Amador el 29 de mayo, tras un año y dos meses de investigación. Esta decisión suponía que Iglesias se preparaba para enviar el caso a la Audiencia Provincial, que será la encargada de juzgar al empresario. Antes de dictar el auto de apertura oral, la jueza debe recibir los escritos de las partes. Fuentes de las acusaciones populares de PSOE y Más Madrid le dicen a este diario que aún no han enviado los suyos. El juicio tardaría aún varios meses en celebrarse. La jueza Iglesias está tomando las últimas decisiones en el caso antes de retirarse ya que ha comunicado su decisión de jubilarse. Según habían adelantado fuentes de los juzgados esta iba a ser su última semana antes de colgar la toga, porque el mes de agosto tomará sus vacaciones, antes de que la jubilación sea efectiva. Iglesias dejará a medias el otro procedimiento que abrió contra Amador, por un presunto soborno en el ámbito empresarial. En esa pieza, la pareja de Ayuso es investigado por un pago sospechoso de medio millón a un ejecutivo de Quirón que le ha dado negocio durante años. ¿Tiene algo que contar?

Datos de tendencia, por delito y en cada ciudad Los altercados en Torre-Pacheco han reabierto el debate sobre la criminalidad. España ha sido tradicionalmente un país seguro. ¿Han subido los delitos en los últimos años? A continuación analizamos los datos oficiales del Ministerio de Interior, que recoge las infracciones conocidas cada año por las fuerzas de seguridad. En España se registraron 2,4 millones de hechos delictivos en 2024, frente a los 2,2 millones del año 2010. Es una subida del 7%, similar al aumento de la población en ese período (4,5%). La tasa de criminalidad —el número de crímenes por cada 1.000 habitantes— está prácticamente plana. Hubo un bajón claro en los años de la pandemia, que luego se ha revertido. Desde 2010, los delitos anuales han pasado de 48 a 50 por cada 1.000 personas. Además el aumento se puede atribuir por completo a una nueva categoría delictiva: las “estafas informáticas”. Si las excluimos, la tasa de criminalidad habría bajado un 10% desde 2010. Estos datos dicen que el aumento de la población de origen inmigrante —que aumentó un 50% desde 2010— no ha ido acompañado de un estallido de criminalidad. No hay un vínculo evidente entre ambos fenómenos. Aunque siguen en cifras elevadas, las tasas de robos en España se han reducido con intensidad desde 2010. Bajan los hurtos (un 20%), los robos con fuerza en viviendas, vehículos o establecimientos (40%), y las sustracciones de vehículos (50%). También cae la estadística de robos con violencia: han caído al 1,2 por 1.000 habitantes, prácticamente la mitad del pico que alcanzaron en 2012 (2,1). Una excepción en la tendencia general se encuentra en el tráfico de drogas: en 2010 se registraron 14.391 delitos, que en 2024 han llegado a los 21.533, un 50% más. Este aumento puede significar que ha crecido la actividad, pero también podría ser una señal de que aumenta la persecución policial a este tipo de infracciones. Otro delito que crece son las agresiones sexuales. Los “hechos conocidos” que captura la estadística se han disparado en los últimos años: en 2024 se contaron 21.159 delitos contra la libertad sexual, más del doble que en 2010. También se han doblado los de tipificación más grave: los delitos por “agresión sexual con penetración” se han doblado desde 2018. El preocupante aumento de estos delitos podría explicarse por la mayor concienciación sobre la violencia sexual, como subraya el propio Ministerio del Interior: hay mayor disposición de las víctimas a denunciar estos hechos ante la policía que hace 15 años. En sus informes hablan de una reducción de “los niveles de infradenuncia existentes en relación con estos tipos penales”. La tasa de homicidios dolosos y asesinatos consumados se ha reducido un 15% entre 2010 y 2024. Se pasó de 401 muertes a 348. Lo que sí han aumentado son los delitos tentativos pero no consumados. Lo han hecho en tasa y en valor absoluto: en 2010 se contaron 776 homicidios dolosos y asesinatos no consumados, que alcanzaron un pico de 1.359 en 2023, para bajar en 2024 a 995. El mapa y la tabla a continuación muestra las tasas de criminalidad en decenas de ciudades españolas (aquellas con más de 20.000 habitantes). A simple vista permite constatar algunos patrones. Por ejemplo: la criminalidad es mayor en las grandes ciudades y en los destinos turísticos. El municipio con la mayor tasa de criminalidad registrada es El Prat de Llobregat. Destaca porque duplica al siguiente. Una de las razones es seguramente la enorme afluencia de viajeros por el aeropuerto de Barcelona. Le siguen en la lista muchos destinos turísticos, como Adeje (Santa Cruz de Tenerife), Salou (Tarragona), Sant Josep de sa Talaia (Baleares), Sitges (Barcelona) o Santa Pola (Alicante). Entre las grandes ciudades sobresale Barcelona, con una tasa de criminalidad de 92 delitos por cada 1.000 habitantes. Supera con holgura las cifras de Valencia (65), Madrid (59), Sevilla (61), Málaga (52) o Zaragoza (33). La tabla siguiente compara las tasas de diferentes delitos en cada país de la Unión Europea. No es posible comparar todas las tipologías —aunque existe una clasificación estandarizada—, porque no todos los países aportan los datos de la misma forma. Eso también dificulta ofrecer las tasas de delitos totales. Pero hay algunas diferencias sensibles. Los hurtos son la infracción más común en todo el continente. Es un registro donde destacan los países nórdicos, lo que de nuevo obliga a preguntarse si hay diferencias también en el grado de denuncia. España sale malparada en robos con violencia: lleva años con una de las tasas más altas de Europa. Aunque la tendencia es descendente, se registran el doble de estos delitos que en países como Alemania o Italia. Sin embargo, las cifras de España son mejores en el resto de indicadores. Especialmente en homicidios donde aparecemos en el puesto 23 de 29 países, seguramente la estadística con menos problemas de subregistro o diferencias en las definiciones. Para comparar, la cifra de Estados Unidos es ocho veces peor que la de España. Casi todos los países de la Unión Europea tienen bajas tasas de homicidios.",fe7f665e2497a7505427c8faa144c88020393b4e4d5cf372cd5bd88fcb76b91f,d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e

They identified the deceased as Sandeep and Arif, residents of the B block area in Khayala. According to the police, a call was received from Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hospital to the Khayala police station about two men admitted with stab injuries between 10 pm and 11 pm. They both succumbed to injuries in the early hours of Monday. “As per the information available so far, two friends, who have known each other for years, were sitting in the park. An argument over something started between them, and it escalated to a scuffle. During the brawl, both of them stabbed each other using sharp-edged weapons,” said Vichitra Veer, Deputy Commissioner of Police, West. According to a police officer, neighbours saw the men lying injured in the park and rushed them to the hospital. Sandeep worked as a property dealer and previously as a gym trainer, said the police, adding that both men were married and had children. The park where the two were sitting was under the jurisdiction of Tilak Nagar police station. Teams from both Khayala and Tilak Nagar stations are now investigating the matter. The police are now questioning the neighbours and family members of the deceased to find the cause of the conflict between the two. They are reviewing CCTV footage from the area to establish the sequence of events. The bodies have been preserved for postmortem at the DDU Hospital Monday. Meanwhile, the Delhi Police crime data shows that 107 cases of murder were reported between January 1 and March 31 in 2025, a slight uptick from 105 in 2024 during the same period, but lower than 2023, when it was 115.

Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Mohali Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Harmandeep Singh Hans, said several special teams were constituted to trace the rising number of heinous crimes in the district. The operation was led by SP (Operations) Talwinder Singh, SP (PBI) Deepika Singh, DSP (City-2) Harsimran Singh Bal, and DSP (Economic Offences) Rajesh. Under this operation SHO Amandeep Singh and inspectors Gabbar Singh and Gagandeep carried out an investigation based on an FIR registered on July 12. According to the complainant, the incident occurred during the night of July 11–12, when she was returning from Best Tech Mall after watching a movie with her friend. Near Lakhnour turn, four bike-borne youths, dressed in Nihang attire, intercepted their car. The miscreants forcibly dragged her out of the vehicle and kidnapped her friend before fleeing the scene in the stolen car, the complaint stated. The SSP said that after assaulting the kidnapped boy, the accused threw him about 100 meters away. They then fled with the girl, kept her with them for approximately 30 minutes and later pushed her out near a gate before escaping towards Ambala. SSP Hans identified the arrested accused as Shamsher Singh, a resident of Gurdaspur; Satnam Singh (from Ludhiana), who works as a cab driver; Nirmal Singh (Nawanshahr), employed as a security guard; and Chander Mohan, alias Jaildar (Jammu), who also works as a security guard, All four were residing at a PG located behind Gurdwara Singh Shaheedan, Sohana in Mohali.

Sanjay Verma was shot dead on Monday at around 10 am, right outside his showroom in Abohar. According to eyewitnesses, three motorcycle-borne assailants lay in wait for him. The moment Verma stepped out of his car, they opened indiscriminate fire, killing him on the spot before fleeing the scene. While the shooters escaped and have yet to be identified, the Punjab Police announced the arrest of two of their accomplices, Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan, both residents of Patiala district, for helping the shooters escape in the car. However, within hours, both men were killed in a police encounter. This development has added fuel to the controversy. BJP General Secretary Manjinder Singh Sirsa accused the Punjab government of mishandling the law and order situation. On his visit to Chandigarh Wednesday, Sirsa said, “First of all, the Punjab government is not able to control the law and order and criminals… Punjab has become a police state. If Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has a clean image, he should get a CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) inquiry conducted into these encounters so the truth comes out.” Reacting sharply, AAP’s Punjab state president Aman Arora called the BJP’s stance “extremely shameful,” accusing it of siding with gangsters instead of supporting Verma’s bereaved family. Arora said, “While the entire Punjab stands with the family of Shri Sanjay Verma, Manjinder Singh Sirsa’s open support for gangsters today proves that the BJP is backing criminals even through central jails.” After meeting the family of Sanjay Verma on Monday, Arora had stated that gangsters lodged in jails outside Punjab were behind such heinous criminal activities. Whereas, Union Minister of State Ravneet Singh Bittu held the Mann government responsible for the ‘growing fear and lawlessness’ across Punjab. “Instead of owning up to their failure, AAP leaders are shamelessly pointing fingers at the Centre. This is not governance –it’s a complete abdication of duty,” he added. Bittu called Arora’s remarks “irresponsible” and “highly condemnable,” accusing him of trying to deflect attention from the AAP government’s failure to maintain law and order in the state. In a statement released on Monday, Bittu announced that he would write to the Governor of Punjab, urging him to take cognisance of Arora’s “baseless allegations”. He also sought written clarifications from Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav and Chief Secretary KAP Sinha, questioning whether Arora’s statement reflected the official position of the Bhagwant Mann-led government. “Aman Arora’s claim that gangster Lawrence Bishnoi is safe in Gujarat under the Centre’s protection is nothing but an excuse to hide the AAP government’s incompetence. These kinds of inflammatory and misleading remarks are both dangerous and unacceptable,” said Bittu. He reaffirmed that the central government has always taken a tough stance against terrorism and organised crime. “We conducted surgical strikes inside Pakistan when needed. Do you think gangsters are beyond our reach? Once the BJP forms government in Punjab, we’ll show what decisive action really looks like,” Bittu said. Pointing to the killing of Sanjay Verma, Bittu accused the Punjab government of completely surrendering to the gangster nexus. “Extortion threats and targeted killings have become the new normal for Punjab’s business community,” he said. Adding to the political slugfest, AAP’s Abohar constituency in-charge Arun Narang displayed a photo showing Abohar MLA Sandeep Jakhar with Shakti, a bike driver allegedly linked to the murder. Sandeep Jakhar, who is a suspended Congress MLA and nephew of Punjab BJP chief Sunil Jakhar, clarified that the picture was from the 2022 assembly election campaign. “Many people get pictures taken with us during campaigns. It’s illogical to link that picture to this crime,” he said. ‘We have full trust’ Jagat Verma, elder brother of Sanjay Verma, has expressed satisfaction over the police probe. In a video, Jagat Verma said, “We have full trust in the Punjab Police and we are satisfied with the ongoing police investigation. We humbly appeal to one and all to please stop doing politics over this issue. We appeal to the police to nab the rest of the culprits soon… We trust that we will get justice soon.” State of probe The police said their investigations have revealed that the getaway bike was driven by one Shakti, a daily wager from Azimgarh village of Abohar. While escaping, the attackers lost control of their bike and forcibly snatched another two-wheeler. They later abandoned it on Seeto Road and allegedly fled in a waiting Swift car, driven by Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan. Jaspreet Singh’s family has denied any involvement, alleging that he was picked up from his house in Mardankheri village of Patiala during the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday, and that they later received news of his death. They maintain that Jaspreet was a daily wager with no criminal background. The police said Jaspreet had a criminal background, and released a few pictures of him brandishing weapons. The details of his criminal record haven’t been revealed as of now. At the time of filing this report, the postmortem examination of Jaspreet and Ram was underway at the Abohar Civil Hospital under strict police cover. Meanwhile, gangster Aarzoo Bishnoi had claimed responsibility for the murder on social media, tagging Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar and Maharashtra’s Shivam Lonker hours after the murder. After the alleged encounter, Bishnoi again posted that the real shooters remained at large, and that Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan had no role in the killing. The Punjab unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has identified the Lawrence Bishnoi gang as the perpetrators behind this crime. The police, however, have not confirmed these claims nor provided clarity on the identities of the actual shooters.",e5f95abfc958db5d8cdbca385844d557be4c91c691308cd7d60da76720ec2964,110f9aeaaf40f7b999bac5a862114640

Their online conversations quickly grew into what seemed like a genuine relationship, and soon, talks of marriage followed. But the connection, which appeared to promise a shared future, turned out to be an elaborate cyber scam in which he was allegedly duped of a staggering Rs 1.55 crore over eight months. The investigation revealed that the cybercriminals, operating behind the profile of ‘Anamika,’ gradually gained the complainant’s trust and allegedly requested large sums of money. On the pretence of building a future together, ‘Anamika’ allegedly convinced him to transfer funds to purchase a house without ever having met. Over time, the scammers further manipulated him into investing in various trading apps, luring him with promises of exceptionally high returns, said the police. After spending nearly all his life savings and facing further demands for more money, he realised he had been deceived. When he tried to recover his funds, ‘Anamika’ allegedly abruptly stopped all communication with him. The police filed an FIR in March based on his complaint. The investigation by the cybercrime police station in Pimpri Chinchwad unearthed an elaborate network of mule account handlers allegedly operating from Solapur and with links to cybercriminals masterminding these scams from China. The police zeroed in on one particular mule account registered in Solapur in June. As the account holder was questioned, he spilled the beans on three others from Solapur who had allegedly told him that his bank account would be used for taking funds obtained from gaming applications. As the investigation dug deeper into these three suspects, the police established their identities and roles in the racket. The mule account handlers from Solapur have been identified as Shubham Chandrakant Mantha, 25, a resident of Ashok Chowk; Swapnil Chandulal Baheti, 35, a resident of Hotgi Road; and Prashik Uttam Navghare, 26, a resident of Juna Kumbhani Naka. “Our investigation revealed that Mantha worked for a China-headquartered payment application company, and he and Baheti were in direct contact with the masterminds based out of China. A coordinated search operation was launched for the trio as their roles were confirmed in the probe,” an officer who was part of the probe said. In the second week of June, Mantha and Navghare were arrested from Pune International Airport when they were about to flee to Nepal via Patna. Baheti, too, was placed under arrest. “Investigation revealed an elaborate mule handling and fund siphoning operation with direct links to China,” said an officer. All three suspects are currently in judicial custody.",9865caa283c9b9ddd31c4f3ac55f1c88767cac6e0a52108d705b0426b1b3413e,d113295a560ee830400d4ef5003f9379

The victim, identified as Sanjeev, 19, a resident of Rajiv Colony, Panchkula, had reportedly come to the area to meet a friend when he was attacked. According to police officials, Sanjeev was surrounded by three to four individuals around 10.30 pm. He was stabbed multiple times in the chest and abdomen with a knife, and then left critically injured on the roadside. The assailants fled the scene immediately after the attack. Soon after, a crowd gathered at the spot, and the PCR was informed. Sanjeev was rushed to the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, Chandigarh, where he succumbed to his injuries during treatment, the police said. The Chandigarh Police have apprehended two minors in connection with the crime. “An FIR has been registered, and the two juveniles have been booked for murder. They will be sent to a juvenile home,” said Vijay Singh, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Chandigarh Police. Sources revealed that the accused allegedly attacked Sanjeev because he was reportedly stalking their sister. The police have not ruled out the involvement of more individuals and are continuing their investigation. Meanwhile, the preliminary postmortem report has stated that the victim died due to punctured vital organs caused by the stabbings. The incident has triggered tension in the area, with residents demanding increased police patrolling and swift justice. Teenager injured in stabbing attack in Sector 40 A 19-year-old teenager was critically injured in a targeted stabbing attack by a group of around half a dozen minors in Block C of Sector 40 in Chandigarh on Sunday night. The assault is suspected to be a result of personal enmity. According to the police, the attackers arrived on three to four motorbikes and were not wearing helmets. They attacked the youth and fled the scene within seconds. The victim was initially rushed by his family members to a private hospital in Mohali, but was later shifted to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, Chandigarh. Chiranji Lal, Station House Officer (SHO), Sector-39 Police Station, confirmed that the attack appeared to be premeditated and due to a personal dispute. The condition of the victim is stable, he added. Efforts are underway to trace the suspects. The accused are all minors, said the SHO.",b0d6e7aff031ee66a6a91c3cfe94f608d6d756f573b6c8344e68aa9c40b83612,a974bdead49b7c89b18ff058176c3d87

But when public figures cross legal lines, the consequences unfold not just in courtrooms but also under the relentless scrutiny of the public eye. One name that recently forced this uncomfortable truth into the spotlight is Sean “Diddy” Combs, the hip-hop mogul and music industry titan who, after years of whispers and lawsuits, has now been convicted in a federal court. In July 2025, a jury found Combs guilty on two felony counts of transportation to engage in prostitution under the Mann Act, a law dating back to 1910. These charges relate to the coerced travel of his former partner, singer Cassie Ventura, and another woman identified only as “Jane,” both of whom testified during the trial. Combs was acquitted on three other charges, including racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking. Still, the guilty verdict marks a seismic fall for the 55-year-old artist once synonymous with glamour, success, and cultural dominance. Diddy’s story is far from unique. Over the years, several A-listers have been convicted of crimes — from drug possession and assault to manslaughter and tax evasion. This listicle delves into 10 high-profile celebrities with criminal records, focusing only on those with confirmed legal outcomes. Once a towering figure in global music, Diddy’s legacy has been rocked by criminal convictions. In a 2025 federal trial, he was found guilty of two counts of transporting women – including ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura – for prostitution, under the Mann Act. Though acquitted of more serious charges like racketeering and sex trafficking, the felony convictions carry serious legal and reputational consequences. More fallout may follow. Attorney Tony Buzbee claims over 100 men and women have accused Diddy of rape and assault. One woman alleged she was gang raped at age 17 after being drugged at a 2003 party. While Combs’s team dismisses the lawsuits as publicity stunts, the convictions have added weight to the mounting allegations. Sanjay Dutt’s conviction remains one of the most talked-about legal sagas in Indian cinema. In 1993, following the devastating Mumbai bomb blasts, Dutt was arrested under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) for illegally possessing an AK-56 rifle, which was part of a consignment linked to the bombings. Though he was acquitted of terrorism charges, he was convicted in 2006 under the Arms Act for illegal possession of firearms. After years of legal proceedings and appeals, Dutt was sentenced to five years in prison and ultimately served over four years, including time at Yerwada Central Jail. Before becoming Tony Stark, Robert Downey Jr. was one of Hollywood’s most tragic cautionary tales. Struggling with addiction in the 90s, Downey was repeatedly arrested for possession of heroin, cocaine, and unlicensed firearms. He was famously found wandering into a neighbour’s house under the influence and passed out in their bed. In 1999, after multiple probation violations, he was sentenced to three years in prison, though he served roughly a year before early release. In 2009, Bollywood actor Shiney Ahuja was arrested for raping his domestic help—a case that sent shockwaves through the film industry. Though the victim later recanted her statement, the court found the original testimony credible and convicted Ahuja in 2011 under Section 376 (rape) and other charges. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, though he spent about three years in jail before being released on bail pending appeal. Wesley Snipes’ high-flying Hollywood career hit a wall when he was convicted in 2008 on three misdemeanor counts of failing to file federal income tax returns. Prosecutors claimed he hadn’t paid taxes for years, despite earning tens of millions. Though he was acquitted of the more severe felony tax fraud charges, he still served nearly three years in prison. In 1992, boxing champion Mike Tyson was convicted of raping 18-year-old Desiree Washington, a beauty pageant contestant, in an incident that took place at a hotel in Indianapolis in July 1991. The jury found Tyson guilty after about 10 hours of deliberation, rejecting his defense that the encounter was consensual. Tyson was sentenced to six years in prison and served approximately three years before being released on parole in 1995. The conviction shocked the sports world and dramatically altered Tyson’s public image overnight, marking a significant turning point in his career. Despite this setback, Tyson later returned to the boxing ring and expanded his career into entertainment, including notable acting roles such as in The Hangover film series. In 2001, Stranger Things star Winona Ryder was arrested for shoplifting over $5,500 worth of merchandise from a Beverly Hills Saks Fifth Avenue store. She was later convicted of felony grand theft and vandalism, receiving three years’ probation, 480 hours of community service, and fines. The incident damaged her career for years, leading to a hiatus from leading roles in Hollywood. Ryder eventually made a well-received comeback, and her 2000s-era troubles are now often seen as part of the conversation around mental health and celebrity pressure. Shia LaBeouf is known for his acting talent as well as his history of erratic behaviour and legal troubles. Over the years, he has been arrested multiple times for offenses such as disorderly conduct, public intoxication, and drunk driving. One of the most notable incidents occurred in 2017, when LaBeouf was arrested in Savannah, Georgia, for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. During this arrest, he was caught on camera making a racially charged outburst toward police officers. These incidents, along with other arrests for similar behavior, have contributed to his reputation for instability. LaBeouf has also faced civil lawsuits from former partners, most prominently from singer FKA Twigs, who accused him of sexual battery and emotional abuse. While he has not been criminally convicted in these civil cases, the combination of his legal issues and public controversies has overshadowed his career achievements, leading many to view him as a cautionary example of wasted potential in Hollywood. Before becoming a blockbuster actor and producer, Mark Wahlberg had a violent and troubling past. At 16, Wahlberg was charged with attempted murder after assaulting two Vietnamese men during a racially motivated attack. He was convicted of assault and served 45 days in prison. The case drew renewed attention in 2014 when Wahlberg applied for a pardon, sparking criticism from civil rights groups and raising questions about accountability and privilege. Wahlberg has publicly acknowledged his past and expressed remorse, though his request for a pardon was ultimately dropped. Phil Spector, the music genius behind the Wall of Sound, became infamous for a far more sinister reason. In 2009, he was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2003 death of actress Lana Clarkson, who was found shot in his mansion. The trial, his second, after a hung jury, ended in a conviction and a 19-years-to-life prison sentence. Spector died in custody in 2021.",73697cd66a0be055d4dc8648c5cf018f30e228abbd24ff6c1604b1ab6fa4aac5,1676ed0148c17932b20d45559413e540

The doctor received two bullet injuries, and his condition is critical, they said. Ajay Gandhi, Senior Superintendent of Police, Moga, said Dr Aniljit Kamboj, who is in his fifties, was shot at by two men who came to his Harbans Nursing Home at around 2 pm. “The doctor was treating one of them, and discussing medicines when the second man who was standing behind opened fire. Two bullets hit the doctor, including one in the chest. He has been admitted to a private hospital in Moga, and his condition is critical. He is on ventilator,” Gandhi told The Indian Express. He said the police are probing the case from all angles, and checking CCTV footage to identify the suspects. A family member told The Indian Express that Kamboj had received extortion calls from Canada-based designated terrorist Lakhbir Singh Landa, an operative of the banned organization Babbar Khalsa International (BKI). The threat calls were being received since 2022 and the caller was demanding at least Rs 1 crore, said the family member, requesting anonymity. He further said that Kamboj was also given a security cover by the Moga Police but the lone gunman was withdrawn some months ago. Moga SP (investigation) Bal Krishan Singla, said: “An FIR was registered in 2022 after Dr Kamboj had received threat calls. Landa was nominated as an accused in that FIR. However, the family did not inform us about any such latest incident.” Asked if the security cover was withdrawn, he said: “They were having the security cover till some time ago but currently, they had no such threat perception. I would need to check the latest status of their security cover.” The CCTV footage of two suspects who shot Dr Aniljit Kamboj at his clinic in Moga district, Friday. The suspects posed as patients.

Kamboj, a general physician, had solemnized second marriage after the death of his wife. His stepdaughter Tania is a known Punjabi actor. Harjot Kaur said that her father-in-law is on ventilator support after the surgery. “He received two bullet injuries, of which one exited his body. His blood pressure is not stable and he is on ventilator.” “My husband was at the clinic with him. Two men came and posed as patients. One of them told my father-in-law that he was having some skin related ailment. As soon as he bent down to check his leg, the other man who was standing behind opened fire at him,” she said. Inspector Gurwinder Singh Bhullar, SHO Kot Ise Khan, said that the case was being probed from all angles including Landa’s alleged involvement. “Prima facie, the man who opened fire had two weapons and he opened fire with both,” said the SHO. The inspector said that an FIR for attempt to murder was being registered at Kot Ise Khan police station on the statement of Chahat. “We will nominate names of the accused as the probe will progresses,” he said. “The doctor had received extortion calls in the past and was also given the security cover.

The deceased have been identified as dhaba owner Siddarodh Tugudi, 35, his nephew Jagadish Belamagi, 28, and employee Ramanna Bhosga, 40. The police said that the triple murders were in retaliation to a killing that occurred in November last year in connection with a feud between two families who belong to the same village. According to the police, Tugudi and his brothers had murdered a criminal identified as Somu Talikoti over a financial dispute and were released on bail recently. To avenge Talikot’s death, four of his brothers along with associates reportedly orchestrated Wednesday’s attack, the police said. “The police have been warning the families after the murder that took place last year. They belong to the same caste and are relatives. We suspect that these murders were carried out in revenge,” said Kalaburagi City Police Commissioner Sharanappa S D on Thursday. The assailants allegedly stormed the dhaba at 12.45 am, targeting Siddarodh and Jagadish, the police said, adding that they have recovered crucial CCTV footage from a nearby petrol station. The accused had damaged the CCTVs installed at the dhaba. “When the dhaba employees attempted to flee through the back door toward an agricultural field, the attackers pursued them. In the chaos, they killed Ramanna, mistaking him for one of Siddarodh’s brothers.

The accused were riding a motorcycle with a temporary number plate when they were intercepted by the police. Police said that the arrests are linked to the firing incident that took place on the intervening night of June 20-21.

The accused — Sandeep Jawahar Shah, a resident of Solapur, and Salim Khubbuddin Patel, a resident of Navi Mumbai — were arrested in Mumbai and Sangli earlier this month. As per the CBI, it discovered that the two were involved in duping NEET candidates and their parents by falsely claiming to have connections with officials of the National Testing Agency (NTA) that conducts the examination. As per the CBI, Shah initially demanded Rs 90 lakh from each candidate and agreed to accept Rs 87.5 lakh per candidate. The central agency claimed that Shah and Patel would assure candidates that they would receive details of their purportedly increased marks six hours before the official declaration of results. The accused sought to be released on bail on the grounds that probe was completed and their custodial interrogation was not required. The pleas claimed that there was no recovery at the instance of the applicants and they’ll co-operate with the trial after being released on bail. The CBI, however, opposed the pleas stating that the same be rejected as there other accused persons are yet to be arrested and therefore the custodial interrogation of present applicants would be required. However, special judge VP Desai observed that till date (on June 21) “the investigating officer has nothing concrete to show that till what period the other accused will be arrested”. Merely because the other accused persons are yet to be arrested cannot be a ground for rejection of the bail, the judge added. The court further noted that offence under section 7(A) of Prevention of the Corruption (PC) Act is not punishable in imprisonment of life or death and punishment prescribed is not less than three years but will extend to seven years. “Nothing is brought on record against the applicant that he will not be available for trial. Hence discretion in the nature of bail can be exercised in the favour of applicants,” the court held and granted bail to the two on furnishing personal bond of Rs 50,000 each along with other terms and conditions.",4974f52e05170329fc61b34918e72435efd9c5cfb80bb908d716d1ecea37e141,772d6209c825a13e8bd82758db7362e1

(AAP)After news of Murdoch's death broke, Central Queensland University criminologist Xanthe Mallett said, a lot can have changed in almost a quarter of a century, and people may now be able to speak that couldn't at the time . There's always the chance that Bradley Murdoch would have shared some information, and people wouldn't have been able to share that until he's dead, so this may be an opportunity, she said. I'm hoping that people out there do know something. Dr Mallett said DNA could remain active for decades depending on exactly how they've been left , making it possible to identify Mr Falconio if a new lead were to reveal his final resting place.Xanthe Mallett says she will be surprised if we find him, sadly due to the scale of the territory which the police would have to cover . (ABC Newcastle: Romy Stephens) If human remains are found in the bush … whomever they are, if they're human remains, it's likely that they will be able to get DNA from them, either from the bones or from the teeth, she said. So if that person's DNA is on record, as I'm sure Peter's would be, then you could do a match to those remains. It's finding those remains in the first place that is going to be the key challenge. NT Police 'committed' to solving cold caseIn a statement acknowledging Murdoch's death, the Northern Territory Police Force said it was deeply regrettable that Murdoch has died without, as far as we are aware, ever disclosing the location of Peter Falconio's remains .First cop on scene of Falconio case recalls 'bizarre' tip-off from truckiePhoto shows A woman in a police uniform, leaving against a wooden edge.A sergeant who responded to the bizarre dead-of-night call about Peter Falconio and Joanne Lees being ambushed in remote NT has spoken exclusively with the ABC. The Northern Territory Police Force remains committed to resolving this final piece of the investigation, it said. We continue to appeal to anyone who may have information that could lead us to Peter Falconio's remains to come forward, no matter how small the detail may seem. Last month, NT Police announced a $500,000 reward for information leading to the discovery of Mr Falconio's remains, saying investigators still hold out hope of finding his body.Mark Grieve announced in June NT Police would double the reward for information leading to Mr Falconio's remains to $500,000. (ABC News: Samantha Dick) There may be someone out there that he's confided in — whether that's family and friends — we just don't know, Acting Commander Mark Grieve said in June. It's a good opportunity for us to up the ante in regards to the reward. We think there's still people out there that may hold some information. On Wednesday, an NT Police spokesperson said investigators were yet to verify tips they had received since increasing the reward. The Northern Territory Police Force can confirm it has received information since the announcement of the reward; however, the information is yet to be verified, he said.Falconio's family 'still hold out hope'In a statement to the ABC, Peter's parents, Luciano and Joan Falconio, said they remained hopeful their son's final resting place would be found. We didn't have much faith, but we were hoping Bradley John Murdoch would reveal where Peter was before he died, they said. Even now we still hold out hope that his remains will be found. Joan and Luciano Falconio said their son Peter's life was cruelly taken away . (AAP: Paul Benjafield)Upon hearing the news of Murdoch's death, Falconio's parents said their first feeling was of relief . It's like a weight that's been lifted, they said. We are only forced to think about [Murdoch] now that he's died. We don't want to let him ruin our lives more than he already has. The awful thing is our family's future with Peter was cruelly taken away. Today, we instead focus on the three children we have left and our grandchildren. The family also expressed their profound thanks to the Northern Territory Police for the support and continuing efforts to investigate our son's murder .'Vast scale' of searchDuring Murdoch's sentencing in 2005, Chief Justice Brian Martin said the killer put Mr Falconio's body into his vehicle before dumping it somewhere between Alice Springs and Broome — a distance spanning almost 1,700 kilometres.Dr Mallett said, unlike some other no body cases , the scale of the territory which the police would have to cover meant recovering any remains would be challenging unless someone came forward.Bradley Murdoch was convicted of Mr Falconio's murder in 2005 but gave up any chance of parole by refusing to reveal where he left his remains. (Rob Hutchison: AAP) Next year it'll be the 25th anniversary [so] the likelihood of them finding Peter's remains without significant intelligence — which we were all hoping was going to come from Murdoch — it's going to be very difficult, she said. It's a huge area and, without more information as to where to look, I would be very surprised if we find him, sadly. Initial search efforts in July 2001 involved line and motorbike searches as well as aerial searches 60 kilometres north and south of the location where Mr Falconio was last seen alive.Extensive searches for Mr Falconio were again held in 2005.Former investigator of Falconio's murder speaks outPhoto shows A woman in a police uniform, speaking to media.The lead investigator of the 2001 murder of British backpacker Peter Falconio says she is not surprised, but disappointed his convicted killer Bradley John Murdoch never revealed the location of his remains.Dr Mallett said the increased scrutiny on the case after Murdoch's death would be a really difficult time for Peter's family . They would have been hoping that Bradley Murdoch would have had a change of heart, knowing that he was terminally ill, and would have shared information to help the police find Peter, she said. We have to remember Joanne Lees in all of this, too. She lost a partner, she was devastated, and she was vilified as a result of this case. So this will be a very hard time for people who knew and loved Peter, and I'm just sorry that they didn't get any answers before Bradley Murdoch died.

(ABC North Coast: Hannah Ross) This was quite a confronting scene in a very busy area and I want to acknowledge those members of the community who very bravely risked their own safety in front of their own families, Detective Inspector Zimmer said.He said those who intervened likely saved the man's life.Inspector Zimmer said police were hoping to speak with the alleged victim, who regained consciousness on Wednesday afternoon after being put in an induced coma at Gold Coast University Hospital.He said the alleged attacker remained under police guard at Tweed Valley Hospital with minor injuries and would most likely be facing charges once he was released.Police say the street was bustling with people when the alleged assault occurred opposite the town's main supermarket.

(ABC North Coast: Hannah Ross)Detective Inspector Zimmer said the two assaults were unrelated and had no bearing on the safety of Byron Bay as a whole. These are isolated incidents, so in terms of general community safety it has no impact of the general community, he said.After the June assault Byron Shire Mayor Sarah Ndiaye said the council would conduct an audit on areas of concern. Unfortunately Byron has always had a bit of an underbelly in that sense, where we do have a higher rate than we should, or want to, of assaults, she said.Federal Member for Richmond Justine Elliot has promised $1 million each for the Byron, Tweed and Ballina shires to spend on security measures.Cr Ndiaye said she wanted part of the funding to spent on lighting and cameras in the car park where the assault occurred.Posted 17h ago17 hours agoWed 16 Jul 2025 at 8:52amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesAussie dollar falls as unemployment unexpectedly risesLIVEPhoto shows A number of people cross an intersection in Brisbane's CBD.

(Supplied: Ms Bernard's family)Mr Byrnes was charged with Ms Bernard's murder in January last year and has remained in custody since.He has faced several committal hearings in the Cairns Magistrates Court since May, where several witnesses have been cross-examined.Witnesses testifyIn one instance, the former manager of the Exchange Hotel in Coen, Dean Lloyd, said Mr Byrnes was a regular patron at the bar.Mr Lloyd told the court he recalled having a conversation with Mr Byrnes and another customer where they discussed the disappearance of Ms Bernard.He said it appeared to him that Mr Byrnes was intoxicated.

(ABC Far North: Holly Richardson)Ms Greenhalgh said Mr Byrnes made unexpected comments that Ms Bernard's body would not be found by authorities. They were left-field comments about, 'That f**king black b**ch pissing in my car', and how they're never going to find her, she said.More conversationsIn a hearing on Tuesday, Coen resident Neville Shepherd told the court he had a conversation with Mr Byrnes in 2017 or 2018 when he said Ms Bernard had bitten him on the penis.In the same conversation, Mr Shepherd said Mr Byrnes also said he'd roughed her up .Mr Byrnes's lawyer, James Sheridan, questioned Mr Shepherd's recollection of the conversation, noting Mr Shepherd had a hearing impairment.Witnesses gave evidence in person and via video link at several committal hearings in the Cairns Magistrates Court.

We all were surprised on Monday night when he didn't turn up as he said he would and always did when he said that, Mr Longhorn said. The hardest part for me, and I know for many, will be just not being able to say hello again and laugh together. Andrew Longhorn says Zdravko Bilic was always the first to offer to help, and was a kind soul . (ABC Sunshine Coast: Owen Jacques)Mr Longhorn said Mr Bilic was always a joy to play alongside. Zed was a great player, left nothing in the tank and gave it all on the field, Mr Longhorn said. [He was] solid in whichever position he played and always encouraging and friendly. Quick to crack a joke and always present in the moment. Forensic officers remained at the home on Wednesday and dusted for fingerprints. (ABC Sunshine Coast: Owen Jacques)'Not bloody fair'Sunshine Coast Detective Inspector Chris Toohey said Mr Bilic's death had shaken the usually relaxed neighbourhood. He is a community-minded person that is well-loved in the area, he said.

A crime scene has been declared at the Warana address. (ABC Sunshine Coast: Owen Jacques)Maria, who asked not to be named, has lived in the area for the past three years after spending decades in Malta.She said Mr Bilic was always smiling and chatty to passers-by. It makes your day, she said. If you're a bit miserable, you walk and he gives you a smile and talks to you — very, very nice man. [He was] very humble — if you needed help, he would help you.

(Supplied: AFP)The drugs were removed from the consignment which was delivered to a warehouse in Bowen Hills, in Brisbane's inner north.Australian Federal Police allege the three men were in the vicinity of the warehouse when it was delivered. Two of the men allegedly began to unravel the rolls of fabric, as the 24-year-old attended a business to buy an electronic scale to allegedly weigh the illicit drugs they were expecting, ABF and AFP said in a joint statement.Police said that during subsequent search warrants of the warehouse and two vehicles, investigators found and seized the contents of the consignment, four mobile phones, about $7,000 cash, and tools suspected to be used in accessing the methamphetamine.The AFP removed the illicit drugs and the consignment was delivered to a warehouse in Bowen Hills. (Supplied: AFP)AFP Detective Superintendent Adrian Telfer said police had not ruled out the possibility of further arrests being made. Our investigation into the syndicate allegedly responsible for attempting to bring these drugs into Australia is ongoing, he said.The men, aged 22, 24 and 28, from New South Wales have each been charged with one count of attempting to possess a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported border-controlled drug. Tony Nguyen and Ky Brendan did not appear in the Brisbane Magistrates Court when their matters were briefly heard for the first time on Wednesday.Martin Nguyen appeared via video link and applied for bail, but it was refused.All three were remanded in custody and their matters were adjourned until August.Border force officers say they uncovered 597kg of methamphetamine wrapped inside 200 rolls of fabric. (Supplied: AFP)Drugs concealed in 'kilometres' of fabricABF Acting Assistant Commissioner James Copeman said 200 metres of fabric was used for each of the 200 rolls. It is kilometres of fabric that they have used, he said. They have concealed, or attempted to smuggle, all of those smaller packages towards the end of that in the hope it would cause some sort of disruption to our x-ray technologies, of which it did not. Forensic testing found the shipment contained 597kg of methamphetamine wrapped inside 200 rolls of fabric. (Supplied: AFP)He said while concealing drugs in fabric was not a new methodology , this attempt was incredibly sophisticated . The sheer volume of methamphetamine hidden within legitimate-looking fabric rolls speaks to the lengths criminal syndicates will go to, but it also highlights the extraordinary capability of ABF officers to detect and disrupt even the most convincing smuggling attempts, Assistant Commissioner Copeman said.'Six million individual street deals'Detective Superintendent Telfer said the result demonstrated the commitment to combating transnational organised crime and illicit drug trafficking. The people behind importations like this have no regard for the harm and damage that illicit drugs wreak on the Australian community every minute of every day, he said. Methamphetamine is a devastating drug and causes harm not just to the user, but also their loved ones and the wider community. This amount of methamphetamine could have resulted in about six million individual street deals.

We remind the public that the reward for information relating to the disappearance of Peter Falconio has been recently increased. Murdoch was born in the small West Australian town of Northampton in 1958.His life before prison involved working as a mechanic, driving trucks and running drugs across outback Australia.He was 43 when he killed Mr Falconio.In 2001, Mr Falconio and his girlfriend, Joanne Lees, were exploring Central Australia together in what was supposed to be a memorable outback holiday.Joanne Lees and Peter Falconio during their trip to Australia. (AAP)The British tourists were travelling in a Kombi van at night along the Stuart Highway, about 10 kilometres north of Barrow Creek, when Murdoch gestured for them to pull over from his ute.Soon after Mr Falconio hopped out of the driver's seat to talk to Murdoch, a gunshot was heard.The black electrical cable handcuffs Murdoch used to bind Joanne Lees's hands behind her back. (Stringer: Reuters)Murdoch then assaulted Ms Lees, bound her wrists with cable ties and electrical tape and forced her into his vehicle.Ms Lees somehow managed to escape into nearby bushland, and Murdoch drove off into the darkness.Mr Falconio was never seen again.The Kombi van belonging to Joanne Lees and Peter Falconio. (David Gerhaty: Reuters)The 28-year-old's mysterious death ignited a wave of international media attention, partly inspiring the 2005 Australian horror film Wolf Creek.Mr Falconio's family and Ms Lees were thrust into the spotlight in both Australia and the United Kingdom, with Ms Lees subjected to particularly intense scrutiny.Twenty-four years after their son disappeared, parents Joan and Luciano Falconio still do not know what happened to his remains.Murdoch never revealed the location of the young man's body.An undated photo of Peter Falconio and Joanne Lees that was shown during the trial at the Supreme Court in Darwin. (AAP)Catching a killerDuring the early months of the police investigation, when hundreds of suspects were still being treated as persons of interest, there was a major breakthrough — a man reported he knew who did it.He gave the name of Bradley John Murdoch.Police moved quickly and took a DNA sample from Murdoch, who had been arrested in South Australia over allegations he abducted and raped a 12-year-old girl and her mother.The Crown case rested on Ms Lees's ability to identify Murdoch from photographs, as well as DNA evidence linking him to the crime using a blood sample taken from the scene.A police mugshot of Bradley John Murdoch. (Getty Images: Northern Territory Police)The item that ultimately condemned Murdoch was an elastic hair tie found in his ute that belonged to Ms Lees.Former NT police officer Colleen Gwynne, who was the lead investigator in the Falconio case, said an eagle-eyed police officer in her team had noticed the hair tie wrapped around Murdoch's holster while trawling through his belongings.Ms Gwynne told the ABC in 2016 that Murdoch probably didn't know how significant the hair tie was , and suggested he kept it as a trophy .Colleen Gwynne was the lead investigator on the Peter Falconio case. (Supplied)In 2005, Murdoch was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Mr Falconio and attempted kidnapping of Ms Lees, with a non-parole period of 28 years.The court heard Murdoch had put Mr Falconio's body into his ute before dumping it somewhere between Alice Springs and Broome.During sentencing, Chief Justice Brian Martin described Murdoch's offending as nothing short of cowardly in the extreme .He said Murdoch's prospects of rehabilitation were low given his complete lack of remorse and prior offending.Murdoch was acquitted of the rape allegations in South Australia in 2003, immediately before police arrested and charged him over the Falconio case.He had also served time in jail in WA in the mid-1990s for shooting at a crowd of Aboriginal football fans celebrating a victory in Fitzroy Crossing.Bradley John Murdoch being taken to the Darwin police watch house to be formally charged with murder. (AAP)During his two decades behind bars, Murdoch always maintained his innocence.He appealed to overturn his convictions twice, but was unsuccessful.In 2016, the NT government introduced no body, no parole laws with the aim of eliciting a confession from Murdoch by removing his right to parole in 2032.It did not work.This year, NT Police launched a fresh public appeal by offering a new reward of $500,000 for information on Mr Falconio's remains.Acting Commander Mark Grieve from NT Police's Crime and Intelligence Command previously stated in June that police had been speaking to Murdoch. On all occasions, he's chosen not to positively engage with police, he said.Murdoch was transferred to the Alice Springs Correctional Centre in 2022, after previously being housed at Darwin's Holtze prison.His death in custody will be subject to a mandatory coronial inquest.Posted Tue 15 Jul 2025 at 9:14pmTuesday 15 Jul 2025 at 9:14pmTue 15 Jul 2025 at 9:14pm, updated Tue 15 Jul 2025 at 10:22pmTuesday 15 Jul 2025 at 10:22pmTue 15 Jul 2025 at 10:22pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesAussie dollar falls as unemployment unexpectedly risesLIVEPhoto shows A number of people cross an intersection in Brisbane's CBD.

Kylie Stott, Dimitri D'Elio and Danny Clarke pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, murder and arson in a nearly seven-week trial that heard from emergency services, DNA experts, police officers, and pathologists, and was described by a prosecutor as a case about retribution .The jury was shown photos taken by Victoria Police of the burnt car, which contained the remains of Charlie Gander's body. (Supplied: Supreme Court of Victoria)The jury delivered its verdict at Victoria's Supreme Court on Tuesday afternoon, finding D'Elio, who was aged 24 at the time of offending, guilty of all three charges.Stott, who was aged 37 at the time, in a relationship with D'Elio, and described by the prosecution as orchestrating the scheme, was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, guilty of kidnapping and not guilty of arson. The jury found Clarke, who was 38 at the time of offending, guilty of kidnapping and not guilty of murder, manslaughter and arson. All three accused were expressionless as the verdict was read to the court.The prosecution told the jury that the trio was motivated by a desire for revenge. (Supplied: Gander family)A desire for revengeDuring the opening days of the trial, Crown prosecutor Mark Gibson said the court would hear a case about retribution and a desire to punish a person for what they believed they had done.He alleged the trio acted as a team to kidnap, kill and incinerate Mr Gander in an unnecessary, senseless and callous act.Mr Gibson told the court the alleged motive was Mr Gander's cooperation with police investigating a firearms breach by Tyson May, who was a good friend of Stott.Gander's body was found on Christmas Eve 2022. (Supplied: Gander family)Following a police raid in Shepparton in November 2022, Mr Gander gave a police interview and made a witness statement about Mr May possessing a firearm.Mr May was under a firearms prohibition order, Mr Gibson said.A disc with the record of Mr Gander's police interview found its way into the hands of others and cost Mr Gander dearly , Mr Gibson said.The court heard that Mr Gander received a copy of his police interview, which he mistakenly left behind at the accuseds' residence.Mr Gibson presented evidence to the court, including Google searches from D'Elio's phone for a dead body in burned car several days before media coverage of the death, as well as records from Stott's phone labelling the victim as Charlie dead dog Gander .As part of court evidence, the jury travelled from Melbourne to Shepparton, Bunbartha and Nathalia to view key locations in the case.A court appearance to schedule plea dates has been set for later this month.Posted Tue 15 Jul 2025 at 8:34amTuesday 15 Jul 2025 at 8:34amTue 15 Jul 2025 at 8:34am, updated Yesterday at 1:29amWed 16 Jul 2025 at 1:29amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesAussie dollar falls as unemployment unexpectedly risesLIVEPhoto shows A number of people cross an intersection in Brisbane's CBD.

(ABC News: Dane Hirst)In short:The Northern Territory's police union president says a death or serious incident in custody is inevitable under the dangerous conditions inside the Palmerston police watch house. One recently released detainee said the women's cells were stained with period blood, while another said men had to s**t in front of everyone in cells of up to 16 people.The NT's prison population has soared to record highs in recent months, partly driven by the introduction of tougher bail laws.abc.net.au/news/nt-police-union-warns-of-death-custody-in-watch-house-conditions/105534016Link copiedShareShare articleThe Northern Territory's police union is warning a death or serious incident in custody is only a matter of time under dangerous conditions inside police watch houses.Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that this article contains the name and image of an Indigenous person who has died, used with the permission of their family.Their caution comes amid national attention on Aboriginal deaths in custody, after the NT coroner last week delivered her inquest findings into the 2019 police shooting of Kumanjayi Walker in Yuendumu. It also follows the recent deaths in custody of Warlpiri man Kumanjayi White in Alice Springs and a senior Kardu Rak Kirnmu elder at Royal Darwin Hospital. In a statement, the NT Police Association (NTPA) said 92 detainees were kept in the Palmerston police watch house on Monday, including 76 overflow corrections prisoners.NTPA president Nathan Finn says he's worried about the safety of police officers. (ABC News: Pete Garnish) This is officially out of control, NTPA president Nathan Finn said in a statement. It's not a matter of if, but when a serious custody incident occurs. The growing pressure on police comes just four months after the NT government promised to stop housing corrections prisoners at watch houses in Palmerston and Alice Springs.Corrections Minister Gerard Maley told parliament on March 18 that all prisoners had been moved out of the watch houses and into prisons in Holtze and Berrimah. Mr Finn told the ABC he was extremely concerned by another spike in corrections prisoners held inside watch houses. It's going to end up in a situation where a police officer is hurt, or an inmate in that facility is hurt or killed, he said. We've got no contingencies if someone gets violent. If someone has a mental health episode inside that facility, it's further placing our staff at unacceptable risk. Former detainees describe unhygienic conditionsFormer detainee Willis John Carlow, who was released on Tuesday after 10 days in the Palmerston watch house, said the conditions were horrible . We had to s**t in front of everyone and there was no space, just 10 other people — 16 other people — in one space, he said. You've got to eat while they're taking a s**t so it was pretty bad. Recently released detainees say the conditions inside Palmerston watch house are horrible . (ABC News: Hamish Harty)Another former detainee, who was also released on Tuesday but wished to remain anonymous, said the women's cells were stained with period blood. You've got eight girls crammed into one cell — girls who are on their periods and are not even being allowed to have showers, she said. We're all in this room with someone else's period blood all over the sheets and it's just pushed into a pile against the wall. She said the female inmates had created a barricade of mattresses around the cell's toilet for privacy from male correctional officers walking past. You've got one blocked toilet and then one toilet that barely works and we're supposed to be drinking water from bubblers on top of the toilet, she said. There was a pregnant woman in there who had stomach pains … and for two weeks in a row was asking to see medical [staff]. A Northern Territory Police spokesperson said all watch houses were managed through strict policy, procedures and instructions . The primary consideration in relation to people in police custody is the safety and welfare of the individual, the spokesperson said in a statement. All persons in custody are provided with basic necessities and are treated with respect. Backlog in courts contributing to chaosThe NT's prison population has soared in recent months, partly driven by the NT government's introduction of tougher bail laws.Data from the NT corrections department shows 2,847 prisoners were being held at correctional facilities on Tuesday, including 1,492 at Darwin Correctional Centre. About half of those prisoners are people on remand who have not yet been sentenced or found guilty. Inside the watch house at the police headquarters in Berrimah. (ABC News: Michael Donnelly)The overflow of prisoners is playing out in the courts. More than 185 court matters were listed between just two sitting judges at Darwin Local Court on Tuesday, giving judges about three minutes on average to process each matter. Mr Finn said the NT government had failed to support its tough-on-crime agenda with appropriate infrastructure to cope with rising prisoner numbers. This government continues to beat its chest about locking up more offenders, but it has utterly failed to plan for the consequences of its own policies, he said.Mr Finn also claimed overcrowding inside watch houses was preventing police officers from making arrests. We've heard from a number of members coming through that limitations in watch house space has led to arrests not being made, he said.Gerard Maley said individuals need to stop breaking the law . (ABC News: Pete Garnish)In a statement, Mr Maley said while the government was working to expand corrections infrastructure as quickly as possible , there was no alternative to currently keeping prisoners in watch houses. Police will continue arresting those who break the law, and corrections will continue expanding capacity to ensure those who are remanded or sentenced have a bed, he said. An extra 238 beds are expected to be operational at the Berrimah Correctional Centre by mid-August. That's in addition to the more than 500 new beds in Darwin and Alice Springs that the CLP has delivered since taking office last August.

(Supplied)In short:Jaydn Stimson, who killed SA Police officer Jason Doig in a shooting in 2023, has been ordered to mental health supervision for the rest of his life.Sergeant Michael Hutchinson — who was also shot in the incident — said he did not hate Stimson but never wanted to see him again.Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said the shooting had had significant impact on the wider policing community.abc.net.au/news/jaydn-stimson-sentenced-for-shooting-police-officer-jason-doig/105530072Link copiedShareShare articleNursing his own wounds and cradling his dying colleague in his arms, Sergeant Michael Hutchinson has recounted the life-changing moment of being ambushed by an armed and mentally-unwell man.In a victim impact statement read to South Australia's Supreme Court on Tuesday, Sergeant Hutchinson said he had known the shooter — Jaydn Harley Stimson — since he was five.He was called to a property at Senior, near Bordertown, in November 2023 for a welfare check on Mr Stimson, which he attended with his colleagues Brevet Sergeant Jason Doig and Senior Constable Rebekah Cass.Brevet Sergeant Doig was fatally shot in the incident, while Sergeant Hutchinson was also shot twice — in the head and torso — but survived.In April, Stimson, 27, was found not guilty of the murder of Brevet Sergeant Jason Doig, and the attempted murder of Sergeant Hutchinson due to mental incompetence.The court has now ordered he be subject to mental health supervision for the rest of his life — after hearing victim impact statements from the officers, Brevet Sergeant Doig's family, the Lucindale community and SA Police.Sergeant Michael Hutchinson spoke outside court after Jadyn Stimson was sentenced. (ABC News)Sergeant Hutchinson told the court the officers were attending the property after Stimson became involved in a fight with his brother — and later returned with weapons and shot his dog. I honestly believe if your brother or father were home you would have used your firearms on them, he said.He said while searching for Stimson inside the home, the officers were ambushed and shot, with Brevet Sergeant Doig suffering wounds to his neck and chest. Despite all my efforts to save Jason, he died in my arms, he said. The guilt I carry that Jason died on my watch is something I will live with for the rest of my life. Jaydn Stimson was found not guilty due to mental incompetence. (Facebook)He said his memories of the night were haunting and that despite operations to remove pellet wounds from his body, six still remained inside.He told the court the psychological impact of the incident was ongoing and the ripple effects were far-reaching. He said while he had spent 39 years in the force he would be known for the shooting instead of the countless hours he spent serving the community.Despite this, he said he did not hate Stimson — who was nothing to me now . I hope I never see you again, he said.'It's burnt into my memory'Senior Constable Rebekah Cass told the court she was two extra steps away from being in the room when she heard the gunshots. I had no idea where the sounds were coming from, no idea where my colleagues were, no idea if someone had been shot or if I was next, she said. It turns out, if I had taken two extra steps I would have been in that room, possibly shot, possibly dead.Senior Constable Rebekah Cass was awarded for her bravery during the shooting at Senior, near Bordertown. (Supplied: SA Police) Two steps, that's all it took to change everything. The chaos, the disorientation — it's burnt into my memory. She said she entered the room to a scene which would haunt her for the rest of her life, finding Brevet Sergeant Doig on the ground and Sergeant Hutchinson crouched over. I moved forward and saw that the body on the ground was Jason. Jason was still alive, struggling to breathe — there was blood, so much blood. He was trying to speak and I told him over and over: 'I'm here, I've got you … help is on the way'. I did everything I could to keep him alive. I stayed with him and I spoke with him until his last words She said she desperately called for help on her radio when Brevet Sergeant Doig died, and checked on Stimson.Senior Constable Cass said her one regret was that she had asked the two other officers to attend the job by her side after it was tasked to her and she had unknowingly led them into a nightmare . If I had gone alone, I wouldn't be standing here today — and that thought lives with me every single day, she said. You didn't just kill a police officer, you destroyed countless lives in a single senseless moment of violence. She said it was made more difficult because it was unlikely Stimson would ever understand what he had done.Ever since the incident she said she suffered flashbacks and had changed how she lived, worked and moved throughout the world.'This was entirely preventable'Senior Constable Cass said the system had failed her colleagues by allowing Stimson to be a registered gun owner. This didn't have to happen, this was entirely preventable, she said.Sean Evans says Brevet Sergeant Jason Doig's parents are grieving. (ABC News: Guido Salazar)Sean Evans, a close family friend of Brevet Sergeant Doig read a victim impact statement to the court on behalf of Jason's mother Faye Edwards, in which she described the deep unrelenting sorrow that never goes away . No parent should ever have to bury their child and yet that is the reality that you forced upon me and his family, she wrote. I will never again hear his voice, see his smile or feel his embrace. I often wonder if you truly understand what you have done, if you think about Jason, if you think about the people left behind who will never recover from this. I hope one day you fully grasp the weight of your actions and feel the burden of that for the rest of your life. I will never forget Jason, I will never stop loving him. And I will never stop grieving. What you took from us is beyond measure. The court also heard statements from Brevet Sergeant Doig's step-father and brother.Director of Public Prosecutions, Martin Hinton KC, read a victim impact statement to the court on behalf of the Lucindale community, where Brevet Sergeant Doig was a much-valued and energetic local often affectionately referred to as Action Jason . He was always there to help … always the first to ask 'what can I do to help', Mr Hinton said.Tributes from police and other emergency services flowed for Brevet Sergeant Doig after the incident, and a life-size silhouette of the officer was erected at Lucindale in his honour in April this year.SA Police will 'carry forward his legacy'SA Police Commissioner Grant Stevens similarly told the court the impact of Brevet Sergeant Doig's death on the policing community was significant and enduring .SA Police Commissioner Grant Stevens says the incident has had a wider community impact. (ABC News: Guido Salazar) The impact of a police officer being killed in the execution of their duty is far-reaching, he said. His name will live on forever and be memorialised as a hero. SA Police will remain united in our commitment to carry forward his legacy with honour and purpose. Defence lawyer Andrew Graham told the court he had attended secure mental health facility James Nash House — where Stimson is being detained — to read the victim impact statements ahead of the hearing.He said that while Stimson had not spoken much since the incident and was limited in his articulation, he had visibly reacted when listening to the statements. After listening he said: 'I won't be forgiven, but I want to tell them I'm sorry', he said. He understands that he's unwell but he still feels responsible for what he did. He often thinks about Brevet Sergeant Doig. Mr Graham said his client had appeared in court in person rather than via video link to try and better acknowledge what was being said to him . He understands that he will be detained for many years, he said.A memorial was erected for Brevet Sergeant Jason Doig in Lucindale earlier this year. (ABC News: Carl Saville)He said Stimson's mother, Lynette Stimson, wanted to convey to the court that her heart broke for the officers, their families and the communities impacted when she learned of the shooting and was distraught and blames herself for what happened.He said Stimson had been diagnosed with schizophrenia since the incident and his recovery had been slow because he had not responded adequately to two different antipsychotic medications.He said a third medication had improved his symptoms.At the April hearing, Justice Sandi McDonald said she found Stimson mentally incompetent on the basis his thinking and judgement were profoundly affected by psychosis .At an earlier hearing, the court had heard Stimson had been diagnosed with a psychotic mental illness which was likely to be schizophrenia .Justice McDonald will formally deliver reasons for her findings on a date to be set.Posted Tue 15 Jul 2025 at 2:09amTuesday 15 Jul 2025 at 2:09amTue 15 Jul 2025 at 2:09am, updated Tue 15 Jul 2025 at 5:11amTuesday 15 Jul 2025 at 5:11amTue 15 Jul 2025 at 5:11amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)If you need someone to talk to, call:Lifeline on 13 11 14Kids Helpline on 1800 551 800MensLine Australia on 1300 789 978Suicide Call Back Service on 1300 659 467Beyond Blue on 1300 22 46 36Headspace on 1800 650 890QLife on 1800 184 527Top StoriesAussie dollar falls as unemployment unexpectedly risesLIVEPhoto shows A number of people cross an intersection in Brisbane's CBD.

Kay Ivey is supporting a state agency’s refusal to release body camera footage in the fatal police shooting of an 18-year-old Black college freshman, saying the case must first be thoroughly investigated.Ivey said she was confident “the facts will prevail” when the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency completes its investigation into the June 23 shooting of Jabari Peoples by an officer with the Homewood Police Department.“This case [is] a top priority, and I am confident they are working to efficiently get this done,” Ivey said in a statement Wednesday to NBC affiliate WVTM 13 in Birmingham.Peoples, an aspiring police detective, was killed at a soccer complex where he was sitting in his parked car with his girlfriend. An officer approached his car around 9:30 p.m. because he said he smelled what seemed like marijuana.Peoples’ girlfriend, whose name has not been released, has denied he had a gun, said family attorney Ben Crump.The officer, who has not been publicly identified, shot Peoples after he said Peoples reached for a gun in the pocket of his car door, according to the police department.Peoples was shot in the back but there was no exit wound on his body and the bullet was not found inside him, according to an autopsy conducted by an independent medical examiner hired by his family.An autopsy conducted by the Jefferson County Coroner’s Office has not been released at the request of the state law enforcement agency.The officer’s body camera video documenting the shooting has become a crucial piece of evidence as Peoples’ family and girlfriend dispute the department’s version of events. The family, local leaders and many Homewood residents are demanding that the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency release it.State Rep. Kelvin Datcher, a Democrat who represents Homewood, said withholding the video undermines public confidence in law enforcement and tarnishes the integrity of the case.“The point of having body camera footage is to ensure transparency for the community,” he said Thursday. “There’s an urgency for the family to get a look at that video.”Protesters showed up to the Homewood City Council meeting this week calling for the video’s release and threatening to boycott local businesses, with the idea that economic pressure might force leaders to change their position.“We will host sit-ins, we will hold dine-ins and vigils through downtown at the doorstep of your businesses,” the Rev. Wayne Harris told the council, according to WVTM. “Your commerce will feel our grief, and we will shut Homewood down for justice.”Deon J. HamptonDeon J.

Miami Herald A former Florida International student who is already imprisoned for threatening to kill his relatives faces more time behind bars after a jury found him guilty of hiring a hit man to murder a federal prosecutor, an FBI agent and others.Anthony Frederick Brillante II, 36, was convicted on Friday of attempted murder of a U.S. government employee, solicitation of a crime of violence and witness tampering. Brillante is expected to receive several more years in prison at his sentencing in early October before U.S. District Judge Melissa Damian in Fort Lauderdale federal court.Brillante’s criminal activity began while he was enrolled at FIU and continued after the FBI arrested him in August 2022, according to federal prosecutors Lawrence LaVecchio and Deric Zacca.Brillante was initially charged with cyber-harassing his relatives in New York, including using hundreds of phone numbers to send his cousin, her husband and their 12-year-old daughter thousands of threatening phone calls and text messages for more than a year, according to court records. Brillante, who spoofed the victims by disguising his identity as the sender, threatened to shoot them in the face and run them over with a car in the cyber messages. The investigation led by the FBI revealed that Brillante was also sending similar threatening messages to another cousin and her husband in Texas.At his first trial in 2023, Brillante was convicted of cyber-harassment charges and sentenced to nine years in prison.But just before the start of trial that October, the FBI launched a sting operation against Brillante while he was held without bond at the Federal Detention Center in Miami.On Oct. 29, 2023, Brillante met with a federal undercover agent posing as a hit man and associate of Brillante’s cellmate. Brillante recruited the agent to kill an assistant U.S. attorney, another FBI agent who was investigating the cyber-harassment case, and his relatives in New York, according to an indictment. Brillante, through intermediaries and bank transfers, paid out a total of $40,000 to execute the deadly plot, the indictment says.His criminal activity on the eve of the initial trial became the basis for additional charges, which led to Brillante’s second trial this month. The Fort Lauderdale jury found him guilty of all 22 counts in the indictment.

The Royal Bahamas Police Force arrested her colleague on the ship with her murder. GoFundMe Bahamian authorities have charged the engineer of a luxury yacht with the murder of a crew member colleague who was found stabbed to death in the vessel’s engine room while it was docked in Eleuthera earlier this month.Bahamian police say the woman, 20-year-old Paige Bell, from South Africa, was reported missing for a short period of time before being found dead on the 142-foot yacht, Far From It, while it was in Harbour Island, Eleuthera, on July 3.Charged with her death is 39-year-old Brigido Muños, a Mexican national who also worked on the vessel, according to Our News Bahamas. Per the news outlet, a judge denied Muños’ bond, and his next court appearance is scheduled for Nov. 20. The Royal Bahamas Police Force said that Muños had “severe” wounds to his arms when they found him, and investigators think he tried to kill himself after he killed Bell. According to the ship tracking site MarineTraffic.com, the Far From It is docked at a Fort Lauderdale marina on the New River this week. Representatives from the company that books trips on the yacht could not immediately be reached for comment. Renting the yacht, which has a crew of eight and can accommodate 12 guests in its six cabins, costs between $140,000 and $165,000 a week, depending on the time of year, according to The Luxury Charter Group. It sails to destinations including the the Bahamas, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, the Windward and Leeward Islands and all the way to north to New England, the company says. Bell’s former shipmates from another yacht, the Sweet Emocean, posted on a GoFundMe page set up to financially help her family, that she was going to celebrate her 21st birthday on July 14. “Paige was more than a teammate, she was family. Her radiant spirit, infectious laughter, and boundless compassion made an unforgettable impact on everyone lucky enough to know her. Whether it was long days at sea or quiet moments under the stars, she brought light and warmth wherever she went,” her former colleagues wrote.“In this difficult time, we want to come together to support the people she loved most, her family.” David Goodhue Miami Herald Go to X Go to Facebook Email this person 305-923-9728 David Goodhue covers the Florida Keys and South Florida for FLKeysNews.com and the Miami Herald.

Two men with connections to Florida are at the center of a sweeping federal indictment unsealed last week in Puerto Rico, accused of orchestrating a massive international fraud scheme that stole more than $650 million from cryptocurrency investors around the world.Michael Shannon Sims, 48, of Georgia and Florida, and Juan Carlos Reynoso, 57, of New Jersey and Florida, were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with OmegaPro, an online investment platform that prosecutors say was actually a global pyramid scheme.If convicted, Sims and Reynoso each face up to 20 years in federal prison on each count.Federal authorities say OmegaPro lured thousands of victims from the U.S., Latin America and beyond — including Florida and Puerto Rico — with false promises of extraordinary returns, up to 300% in just 16 months, supposedly through foreign-exchange trading.But prosecutors say there were no elite traders — just a sophisticated scam.“The defendants preyed upon vulnerable individuals in the U.S. and abroad, defrauding them of over $650 million by making false promises of substantial returns and that their money was safe,” said Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.According to the indictment, Sims and Reynoso — along with other co-conspirators — operated the scheme from 2019 to 2023 by selling cryptocurrency-based “investment packages” and claiming the funds would be managed by expert foreign-exchange traders. Instead, investigators say the money was funneled into crypto wallets controlled by OmegaPro insiders, who then laundered and concealed the funds. Both Sims and Reynoso allegedly pocketed millions.Sims is identified as a founder, consultant, and top promoter of OmegaPro, while Reynoso allegedly ran operations across Latin America and parts of the U.S., including South Florida and Puerto Rico.To build credibility, prosecutors say Sims boasted of OmegaPro’s trading prowess and promoted its so-called “elite” traders. Reynoso is accused of assuring investors that OmegaPro was fully licensed — or alternatively, that it didn’t fall under any country’s regulations.They also went to great lengths to project an image of success, hosting extravagant events around the globe, including one in Dubai, where the OmegaPro logo was splashed across the famed Burj Khalifa skyscraper. On social media, they flaunted luxury lifestyles — high-end cars, designer watches, private jets — all allegedly paid for with investor money.By January 2023, the operation began to unravel. OmegaPro claimed it had suffered a “network hack,” sparking panic among investors. Reynoso and others promised the funds would be transferred to a new platform, Broker Group — but victims say their money was never returned.“This case exposes the ruthless reality of modern financial crime,” said Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Chief Guy Ficco. “OmegaPro promised financial freedom but delivered financial ruin — stealing over $650 million from everyday people and vanishing it into virtual currency.” Antonio Maria Delgado el Nuevo Herald Go to X Go to Facebook Email this person 305-376-2180 Galardonado periodista con más de 30 años de experiencia, especializado en la cobertura de temas sobre Venezuela.

Getty Images A therapist at a mental health and substance abuse treatment facility for women in Miami has been arrested on charges of sexually abusing at least two patients who were under his care. Miami Police say a woman in her 40s reported that Manuel Enrique Garcia, 33, began to touch her inappropriately during a one-on-one session and sexually assaulted her. Afterwards, he told her not to report what had occurred, warning her he could lose his job and she could be discharged and return to being homeless.The woman had been admitted to the facility in February during a “vulnerable depressive episode,” according to police. The assault happened sometime between February and March, she told detectives.According to Garcia’s arrest affidavit, a second victim, a woman in her 20s, told police that approximately two weeks before his Tuesday arrest, he approached her, offered her candy and asked if she needed anything from her personal belongings, which were stored in his office. Once inside, she says he pulled her into the room, kissed her and touched her inappropriately. The woman told investigators that the defendant then made a sexually explicit proposition.She feared retaliation and that Garcia might “document negative remarks in her therapy progress notes, which could potentially harm her standing in court, prevent her from being discharged from the facility, or even delay her reunification with her child,” his arrest affidavit read.A second alleged incident occurred roughly a week later. While she was in Garcia’s office making a phone call, she claims he exposed himself and initiated another coerced sexual act. She also reported that he used his cellphone to record part of the encounter.The woman told detectives that she was paralyzed by fear, particularly given the therapist’s prior knowledge of her trauma history—information she had disclosed in confidence during therapy sessions.Police say several women corroborated the victims’ accounts.Garcia was arrested on Tuesday at 4850 NE Second Ave. per his arrest affidavit. The address matches that of Concept House, a rehabilitation center specializing in addiction treatment. He has been charged with three felony counts of a psychotherapist engaging in sex with a client.He remained in custody at Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center as of Wednesday morning.Detectives encourage anyone with additional information or experiences to contact the Miami Police Department Special Victims Unit at 305-603-6300 or 305-579-6111.

Judkins, 21, was arrested at the Four Seasons Hotel, 525 N Fort Lauderdale Beach Blvd, per a police report.The victim told investigators she waited to report the incident because “she felt bad due to [Judkins’] recent success and career” but changed her mind after speaking with her loved ones. Judkins and his ex-girlfriend had split in December but were rekindling their relationship at the time of the incident, the report shows.READ MORE: Cleveland Browns rookie cuffed after domestic violence incident in Broward: copsJudkins, who faces a misdemeanor domestic battery charge, bonded out of the Broward Main Jail on Sunday. The Miami Herald reached out to his attorney David Weinstein but hasn’t received a response as of Monday afternoon.Judkins’ ex-girlfriend told investigators that their spat began at the baggage claim of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, when Judkins got frustrated after reading messages from family members. The nature of the messages wasn’t mention in the police report.However, their argument escalated when they entered a Lamborghini SUV. Judkins’ ex, according to the report, told him the messages weren’t true, then Judkins punched her in the mouth.Officers noted in the report that she had visible bruising on her chin — and photographs of her injuries.At one point, the victim got out of the SUV and called Judkins’ mother, although she didn’t tell her what had transpired, the report says. She got back inside, and the squabble over the messages continued. Judkins then hit his ex-girlfriend several times while driving, according to the report. She had visible bruises on her arm and thigh — and photos of her injuries, officers noted.She told police she began to kick her feet at Judkins to defend herself, the report says. Shortly after, Judkins pulled into a Burger King parking lot, where his ex told him, “Don’t touch me again.”It’s unclear from the police report what happened in the five days before she reported the incident.Judkins was selected in the second round with the 36th overall pick in the 2025 NFL draft by the Browns after having played for the Ohio State Buckeyes. In 2022, he was named SEC Freshman of the Year when he was a second-string running back for the University of Mississippi Rebels.

A pediatrician accused of murdering her daughter — and staging it as an accidental drowning — has been booked into a Miami-Dade jail after she was transferred from Oklahoma City, according to jail records.Dr. Neha Gupta, 36, faces a first-degree murder charge in the death of 4-year-old Aria Talathi and is being held without bond at Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center. She was expected to appear in court for a bond hearing Thursday.Officers found Aria unresponsive in the swimming pool of an El Portal rental home on June 27 after Gupta called 911. Gupta told investigators she couldn’t swim but tried to rescue the 4-year-old for 10 minutes. Autopsy reports indicated that the child had died before stepping into the water.Instead of finding water in Aria’s lungs or stomach, officials found cuts and bruising in her mouth consistent with being smothered to death, according to Dr. Tuyet Tran of the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner’s Office. They also found no traces of food in her stomach, contradicting claims she made about having dinner with her daughter hours before she died.Mother and daughter traveled nearly 1,300 miles from their Oklahoma home for a beach getaway and arrived at the El Portal Airbnb two days before Aria’s death. Investigators issued a warrant for Gupta’s arrest on July 1. She was apprehended that same day by Oklahoma City Police Department’s Homicide Unit and the U.S. Marshals Service, where she had returned. The pediatrician appeared before an Oklahoma judge days later for a hearing and was quickly returned to Miami.Her lawyers, Michael Mirer and Richard Cooper, say they’re shocked by deputies’ decision to charge her.“Dr. Gupta maintains her innocence. She is a respected physician and a loving mother now facing an unimaginable accusation in the tragic death of her daughter,” Mirer said in a statement to the Miami Herald Thursday. “This arrest was a rush to judgment. The medical examiner has not even determined the official cause or manner of death. We are confident Dr. Gupta will be exonerated once the truth comes to light.”Detectives haven’t disclosed a motive in the girl’s death, but Gupta’s contentious, two-year-long divorce from Aria’s father, pediatrician Dr. Saurabh Talathi, may offer clues. In 2024, judges denied the mother’s request to pursue sole custody and ordered her to pay her ex-husband over $79,000 in attorney fees. Talathi was unaware that the mother had taken their daughter out of state for vacation. His attorneys told the Miami Herald that they wouldn’t discuss the case until the investigation was over. Gupta has since lost her job as a a pediatrician at Oklahoma Children’s Hospital. OU Health and the University of Oklahoma released a joint statement announcing her unemployment: “Dr. Neha Gupta was suspended from patient care, given notice of termination, and was no longer seeing patients at the health system as of May 30, 2025. She has also been given notice of termination by the University.”This story was originally published July 17, 2025 at 10:59 AM.

Appeals judges have now reduced his sentence from 18 to 13 years.https://p.dw.com/p/4xSWKJudges at the Hague in the 2024 ruling said the torture perpetrated by Shala was of particular cruelty. Image: Piroschka van de Wouw/Pool/AP/picture alliance AdvertisementKosovo Liberation Army (KLA) member Pjeter Shala saw his conviction upheld but the sentence reduced from 18 to 13 years, the Kosovo Specialist Chambers tribunal in The Hague said on Monday. The tribunal, staffed by international judges and lawyers, was set up in 2015 to handle cases under Kosovo law against fighters of the KLA. The court said Shala's original sentencing was out of reasonable proportion to comparable cases. Shala was convicted in 2024 of war crimes during the during the 1998-99 Kosovo uprising against Serbian troops. He was found guilty of torture, murder and arbitrary detention, which he committed as he ran a makeshift prison where people considered to be spies or collaborators with Serbs were housed. What did appeals judges say? The original Hague tribunal conviction was appealed, with judges reversing several convictions for torture and arbitrary detention in relation to some victims, but confirming convictions for the same war crimes involving other victims. Judges also determined that the previous conviction had not taken into account that Shala was not in a commanding role for the murder charge. In the end, judges reduced his sentence from 18 to 13 years. The reduction in his sentence in no way suggests that the crimes for which he has been convicted and sentenced are not grave, judge Kai Ambos told the court. Shala exhibited 'particular cruelty' Shala followed the hearing by video link, dressed in a light blue shirt and tie. As the decision was read out, he shook his head and appeared to be speaking but his words were not broadcast. Victims under Shala were beaten with batons and baseball bats, forced to hit each other, burned with cigarettes, coerced to simulate sexual acts with each other, and in some cases shot. Judges at the earlier trial said the torture perpetrated by Shala was of particular cruelty and the victims were particularly vulnerable and defenseless. The victims were largely ethnic Albanians accused by the KLA of collaboration with Serbian forces. More than 13,000 people are believed to have died during the 1998-99 Kosovo uprising against Serbian troops, led by then-president Slobodan Milosevic.

Here's how the death cap became the center of a chilling murder case. https://p.dw.com/p/4x8P8Even small amounts of death cap mushrooms are lethal if consumed.Image: Hans Reinhard/Okapia/picture-allianceAdvertisementA jury in Australia has found Erin Patterson guilty on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder. The murder weapon: Toxic mushrooms. Prosecutors argued Patterson intentionally served four of her family members with meal portions containing toxic death cap mushrooms in 2023. Patterson denied being guilty, originally telling police she had used store-bought mushrooms from a supermarket, then an Asian grocer in Melbourne. A search of such stores found no evidence that poisonous mushrooms had ever been sold. During the trial, Patterson said she may have foraged for the mushrooms but could not say for certain where she had obtained the death caps. Why are death cap mushrooms so deadly? Deadly by name and by nature, death cap mushrooms (Amanita phalloides) are full of a highly stable toxin called alpha-Amanitin. The toxin is so stable that it won't break down when exposed to heat in cooking. When a death cap is eaten, people don’t usually feel symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea until at least 6 hours later. During this time the alpha-Amanitin toxins are making their way through the bloodstream into organs of the body. The toxin primarily acts in the liver, where it causes cells in the liver to die. Alpha-Amanitin binds with RNA polymerase-II enzymes, preventing the cells from creating new proteins. Eventually, the liver starts to shut down. Death can occur within 24 hours. Careful identification required The Amanita genus of fungi is well-known for their toxic properties. This group include the fairytale toadstool commonly known as the fly agaric, death caps, and destroying angels . But some other Amanita mushrooms are edible. Most cases of death cap poisoning are often a case of misidentification — their classic white appearance and domed cap looks like many other types of fungi. Identification of mushrooms requires a knowledge of different parts of the anatomy: the cap or fruiting body, the gills or spores beneath the cap, and the stipe — or stalk. While death caps look like many other mushrooms, one defining characteristic is their bad smell. They don't store well at all, unless you dehydrate them. They quickly go very stinky and very nasty, Brett Summerell, a fungi expert and Chief Scientist at the Botanic Gardens of Sydney, Australia, told DW. Because of the risk of misidentification by amateurs, it's usually recommended that foragers go for edible species that cannot be mistaken. Of course, foraging under the supervision of a trained mycologist — a fungi scientist — is usually a safe option. The famous red and white toadstool is a member of the Amanita genus, and a cousin of other deadly mushroom species.Image: FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP No death caps in the supermarket The jury ultimately didn’t find Patterson’s defense — that she mixed up foraged mushrooms in the same container as store-bought ones — believable. The prosecution argued Patterson knowingly put the toxic mushrooms in the home-cooked lunch and disposed of evidence. Summerell said the likelihood that death caps could get into store-bought products is, to be honest, farcical. The reason? Death caps only grow next to oak and beech trees. Death caps, like many fungi, are mycorrhizal, meaning they have a symbiotic relationship with the tree species. Death caps obtain their nutrients from nearby tree roots and return nutrients to the nearby soil. But because they can only grow at the base of oak and beech trees, it means there's no chance of them sprouting in a commercial setting, where spores are cultivated in highly controlled conditions — and with no trees in sight. Australia could get rid of death caps Death caps aren’t native to Australia, and neither are the oak and beech trees that support them. The trees were first introduced into Australia from Europe in the 19th ecntury, and death caps in the 1960s. Summerell and other mycologists are now discussing the possibility of removing oak trees in some parts of Australia. We have argued that, in Sydney, if it's at all possible, we should start to think about removing oak trees from some of these suburbs just from the point of view of a public health risk, said Summerell. Removing introduced oaks could harbor positive benefits, both from a public health perspective by removing the risk of the top cause of mushroom poisoning, as well as providing more space for native Australian plant life.

But some criminologists doubt the figures.https://p.dw.com/p/4wuVjShoplifting is on the rise, say retailersImage: Carsten Milbret/imageBROKER/picture allianceAdvertisementGermany has never had more shoplifters than in 2024. An annual survey of 98 retailers estimates a 3% increase on the year before — amounting to some €4.95 billion ($5.84 billion) in losses. The latest study by Germany's Retail Institute (EHI) on inventory differences shows that the vast majority of those losses (€4.2 billion) was down to theft from customers, employees, or delivery workers, the EHI said, which would mean losses of some €570 million to the public purse through lost sales tax. The EHI also said that retailers had to resort to balancing out their losses and the costs of extra security by increasing prices. Study author Frank Horst calculated that some 1.5% of prices in stores could now be attributed to covering theft and security. Shoplifting techniques The EHI said there had also been a 5% increase in organized shoplifting, which accounted for a third of the total shoplifting losses. Horst said this could be individual thieves working their way through a shopping list, or else, the thefts could be carried out by coordinated groups. One of them drives a vehicle, one of them distracts the staff, or shields the one putting the goods away so they can't be seen, Horst told DW. Sometimes so-called depots are set up in the store, where all the goods are packed in a bag, and then someone else carries it out in a surreptitious moment. The survey does not include exact breakdowns of the kinds of articles that get stolen, but Horst says that thieves often target anything small, expensive, and that can be easily re-sold, such as perfume and cosmetics. There had also been a rise in the theft of foods, especially relatively expensive things like meats and cheeses. But Nicole Bögelein, a criminologist at Cologne University, cast doubt on how useful the study actually is. She told DW that the researchers estimate that 98% of cases aren't even discovered. So it's just an assumption that the majority of these losses can be attributed to theft, she said. Bögelein also cast doubt on the EHI's conclusion that there are more organized shoplifting gangs, as that could simply be because store detectives are more on the lookout for such groups. 'Poverty crimes' Despite its shortcomings, the annual EHI survey is one of the few shoplifting studies there are, and it is focused mostly on the economic impact. Bögelein, by training a sociologist as well as a criminologist, has a different perspective and says that almost all cases of shoplifting are so-called poverty crimes — defined as crimes that don't cost any money to carry out, and are committed by people because they have no money. Bögelein's own investigations into shoplifting have found that the people who are caught are often poor — possibly, she says, also because store detectives are more likely to keep an eye on people who look poor. Official statistics suggest that the majority of thefts from shops are relatively petty. According to German federal police statistics, in 66.7% of discovered and prosecuted thefts, the value of the items stolen was under €50 and in 40.2% of cases even under €15. The punishment is usually a small fine, or, if the fine can't or won't be paid, a prison sentence. Germany a 'paradise' for shoplifters? Horst described Germany as a paradise for shoplifters, as the punishments are often relatively mild. Though theoretically thieves can be imprisoned for up to five years, he said that in practice first-time offenders are often not charged at all. Bögelein said that deterrence might have an effect on some minor thefts, but was generally skeptical of the idea that more punishment discourages petty crime. People don't not steal because they're scared of punishment, she argued. In criminology, we find that people stick to rules because they think those rules are correct and because they fear a bad conscience if they don't stick to them. Public transport operators in Germany often charge people a fee for riding without a ticket, but may also press charges, especially for repeat offenders.Image: picture-alliance/dpa/J. Wolf Should shoplifting be decriminalized in Germany? There has been a debate among German criminologists about to what extent poverty crimes should be decriminalized altogether, on the grounds that such crimes are usually victimless and therefore don't require criminal justice. There have long been calls to downgrade one classic poverty crime — riding public transport without a ticket — to a misdemeanor, partly because punishing it has become a burden to public coffers and is clogging up the justice system. Between 8,000 and 9,000 people end up in prison in Germany every year for riding without a ticket. But Horst argued that shoplifting shouldn't always be defined as a poverty crime: The EHI estimates that two-thirds of shoplifting cases were what he called opportunistic perpetrators, and many of them are not necessarily poor. Horst does think that inflation and higher prices for basic items may be playing a role in the rise of shoplifting, but he was reluctant to accept that poverty was the driving element of all theft. It could be a protest theft, because people are saying they're not prepared to accept the price rises for a particular product, he said, I'm sure poverty is a part of it, but that it explains the rise on its own — I don't see that.

Shoplifting techniques The EHI said there had also been a 5% increase in organized shoplifting, which accounted for a third of the total shoplifting losses. Horst said this could be individual thieves working their way through a shopping list, or else, the thefts could be carried out by coordinated groups. One of them drives a vehicle, one of them distracts the staff, or shields the one putting the goods away so they can't be seen, Horst told DW. Sometimes so-called depots are set up in the store, where all the goods are packed in a bag, and then someone else carries it out in a surreptitious moment. The survey does not include exact breakdowns of the kinds of articles that get stolen, but Horst says that thieves often target anything small, expensive, and that can be easily re-sold, such as perfume and cosmetics. There had also been a rise in the theft of foods, especially relatively expensive things like meats and cheeses. But Nicole Bögelein, a criminologist at Cologne University, cast doubt on how useful the study actually is. She told DW that the researchers estimate that 98% of cases aren't even discovered. So it's just an assumption that the majority of these losses can be attributed to theft, she said. Bögelein also cast doubt on the EHI's conclusion that there are more organized shoplifting gangs, as that could simply be because store detectives are more on the lookout for such groups. 'Poverty crimes' Despite its shortcomings, the annual EHI survey is one of the few shoplifting studies there are, and it is focused mostly on the economic impact. Bögelein, by training a sociologist as well as a criminologist, has a different perspective and says that almost all cases of shoplifting are so-called poverty crimes — defined as crimes that don't cost any money to carry out, and are committed by people because they have no money. Bögelein's own investigations into shoplifting have found that the people who are caught are often poor — possibly, she says, also because store detectives are more likely to keep an eye on people who look poor. Official statistics suggest that the majority of thefts from shops are relatively petty. According to German federal police statistics, in 66.7% of discovered and prosecuted thefts, the value of the items stolen was under €50 and in 40.2% of cases even under €15. The punishment is usually a small fine, or, if the fine can't or won't be paid, a prison sentence. Germany a 'paradise' for shoplifters? Horst described Germany as a paradise for shoplifters, as the punishments are often relatively mild. Though theoretically thieves can be imprisoned for up to five years, he said that in practice first-time offenders are often not charged at all. Bögelein said that deterrence might have an effect on some minor thefts, but was generally skeptical of the idea that more punishment discourages petty crime. People don't not steal because they're scared of punishment, she argued. In criminology, we find that people stick to rules because they think those rules are correct and because they fear a bad conscience if they don't stick to them. Public transport operators in Germany often charge people a fee for riding without a ticket, but may also press charges, especially for repeat offenders.Image: picture-alliance/dpa/J. Wolf Should shoplifting be decriminalized in Germany? There has been a debate among German criminologists about to what extent poverty crimes should be decriminalized altogether, on the grounds that such crimes are usually victimless and therefore don't require criminal justice. There have long been calls to downgrade one classic poverty crime — riding public transport without a ticket — to a misdemeanor, partly because punishing it has become a burden to public coffers and is clogging up the justice system. Between 8,000 and 9,000 people end up in prison in Germany every year for riding without a ticket. But Horst argued that shoplifting shouldn't always be defined as a poverty crime: The EHI estimates that two-thirds of shoplifting cases were what he called opportunistic perpetrators, and many of them are not necessarily poor. Horst does think that inflation and higher prices for basic items may be playing a role in the rise of shoplifting, but he was reluctant to accept that poverty was the driving element of all theft. It could be a protest theft, because people are saying they're not prepared to accept the price rises for a particular product, he said, I'm sure poverty is a part of it, but that it explains the rise on its own — I don't see that.

After the shooting, the officer and his colleague walk away. Police's reaction to the shooting Police did not directly deny any cooperation with the armed goons, releasing a statement saying it does not condone such unlawful groupings. Police also said the officer who shot Kariuki in the head using an anti-riot shotgun had been arrested. Activists called for the officer to be charged. The judiciary in a statement on Wednesday said it was committed to uphold justice in all cases, including those involving alleged police brutality.

Kenyan government's latest finance bill avoided the tax hikes that sparked weeks of protests in mid-2024. Rights groups say over 60 people were killed and dozens more were illegally detained by security forces in the aftermath. The protests peaked when thousands stormed parliament on June 25, 2024 when lawmakers debated the unpopular finance bill. The bill is now expected to take effect on July 1, 2025. But demonstrations picked up again over the death of 31-year-old teacher and blogger Albert Ojwang, who died in police custody earlier this month. Protesters want a senior officer they blame for the death to resign.

Why is there a market for her content in the Balkan country and how are some Bulgarians fighting it?https://p.dw.com/p/4vrvKOn her social media profiles, Bulgarian influencer Zornitsa Gyutsova posts misogynistic advice about how men should 'deal with' womenImage: Zgyutsova/TikTokAdvertisement Women love men who can be violent if need be. That's why they like men who hit them, Bulgarian influencer Zornitsa Gyutsova tells her followers. Gyutsova suggests that not only do women prefer men who physically assault them, but that this is also the way men should behave because a woman should respect a man's physical power since she is unable to comprehend his intellectual power. This is the kind of advice that can be found on Gyutsova's social media profiles and in a private group founded by her on Telegram called Upstanding Man. 'Equality is contrary to human nature' Zornitsa Gyutsova offers her followers private chats over video where she teaches them how to deal with women — for a fee, of course. Many influencers, life coaches and other online personalities in Bulgaria and elsewhere offer private sessions or courses. What makes Gyutsova's content stand out from the rest is that its sole purpose is to explain to men that they need to learn to control their partners both psychologically and, if necessary, physically.There have been numerous protests against violence against women in Bulgaria in recent years, such as this one in 2023Image: Alexandar Detev/DW In Gyutsova's view, men in general have been treated badly by women, and women are the ones who exert violence on men, namely by not paying them enough respect. The idea of equality is like a worm in people's brains that insists men and women should be partners […] which is so contrary to human nature that it can never work, Gyutsova declared in a long video about her work that was broadcast on Bulgarian National Television. Although the broadcaster, which is partly financed by taxpayer's money, has since removed the video from its platforms, it has never publicly commented on the case. Huge backlash Gyutsova's profiles on social media have been gaining traction for several years now. Screenshots and videos from her private Telegram group chat recently surfaced on social media, triggering a huge backlash in Bulgaria. Local woman Petya Krasteva was so appalled by Gyutsova's online content that she filed a complaint against Gyutsova with the prosecutor's office. On her social media channels, she not only encourages people to degrade women and use violence against them, she also boasts that she uses the same methods on her child and her cat, she told DW. I thought to myself: This is not only absolutely unacceptable, it's criminal. Gender discrimination not a crime in Bulgaria Many other women did the same as Krasteva, only to find out a couple of weeks later that their efforts had been in vain.Petya Krasteva was appalled by Zornitsa Gyutsova's online content and filed a complaint against her with the prosecutor's officeImage: Nikola Gyulmezov In an official reply, the prosecutor's office stated that nothing could be done because Bulgaria's criminal code does not define gender discrimination as a crime and that the issue was a matter for the Commission against Discrimination. Krasteva promptly lodged a complaint with this commission, but received another negative answer based on the same reasoning. Profiles briefly taken down Although these complaints did not lead to charges being brought against Gyutsova, the backlash did have an impact. The outcry and the fact that Gyutsova's social media accounts were reported by people who found their content abhorrent, meant that the influencer's TikTok and Instagram profiles were deactivated. They were, however, reactivated a short time later. Impunity for abusers Krasteva feels that part of the reason why content like Gyutsova's strikes a chord in Bulgaria is that while patriarchal norms and domestic violence are not accepted in the country, Bulgarian society often turns a blind eye to them. The other huge problem, she says, is that as with many other social issues, there is a complete lack of consequences for the perpetrators. Valentina Dimitrova, a psychologist who works for the Emprove Foundation, a Bulgarian organization that supports women who have suffered domestic violence, holds a similar view.Psychologist Valentina Dimitrova says that content like Gyutsova's is dangerous because 'it can truly cost a human life'Image: Venera Velkovska Sadly it's embedded in the Bulgarian mindset that we often just accept that things are bad and we do nothing about it, says Dimitrova. She believes that this is also why many women stay in violent relationships: They simply have no faith in the authorities because time and time again, men who beat or even kill their partners face no legal consequences. Although some people seem to think that social media content is less problematic than actual abuse in real life, Dimitrova stresses the dangers associated with such content: It can truly cost a human life. A global online problem Misogynistic online content that paints women as lesser human beings and men as oppressed by women is not unique to Bulgaria. Such content has been growing and spreading all over the world in recent years. Influencers like Andrew Tate, who faces charges of rape, bodily harm, human trafficking and more, have created a whole movement around this sort of content. Gyutsova fits neatly into this category of influencer, but what makes her different is that she is a woman. What role does feminism play? Dimitrova thinks one issue here is that feminism is often misunderstood. Feminism does not entail men being suppressed and women controlling them. It means that women can have equal rights and can function as equals to men not only in society but also in their personal relationships, she says. Dimitrova also believes that the patriarchal notion that men should not be allowed to express emotions is highly problematic. This is reflected in Gyutsova's content, which suggests that men are weak and not manly if they dare to express their fears, emotions or feelings.People in Sofia attend a protest against domestic violence and violence against women in Bulgaria in 2023 after a young woman was stabbed by her ex-partner Image: Alexandar Detev/DW It's a vicious circle: Men who are not allowed to express any sort of emotion for fear of being labeled weak don't know what to do when they experience something frustrating in their relationships and so they resort to aggression, says Dimitrova. What can be done? Dimitrova suggests that first and foremost, men should receive support and their concerns should not just be swept under the carpet. She stresses, however, that this support should not validate the inclination to deal with problems by exerting psychological or physical violence on women. Although the Emprove Foundation focuses primarily on women's rights and issues, it does have a project that focuses on men's mental health — something the foundation says is incredibly important in the fight against gender-based violence. Men should be encouraged to connect to a healthy understanding of themselves, so they can build healthy relationships as well, says Dimitrova. Petya Krasteva firmly believes that even though authorities in Bulgaria rarely provide the support needed in cases like this, society should not remain indifferent. We should be as loud as possible when something like this turns up, she says. We should be perfectly clear that it is unacceptable. That way, other people who come across this content will know that this is not something that society approves of, and that could help them realize that they shouldn't have anything to do with it. Dimitrova agrees. We will keep talking about it [this kind of content], calling it out and not tolerating it until the authorities wake up.

Why did an Argentinian court ordered an international warrant for her arrest?https://p.dw.com/p/4uJX3Aung San Suu Kyi has been imprisoned by the Myanmar military since 2021 (archive picture from 2012)Image: Loviny Christophe/ABACA/picture alliance AdvertisementIt is rare for an international arrest warrant to be issued against a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and political prisoner whose release is demanded by both the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council. However, this is precisely what occurred in February this year, when an Argentinian court asked for the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi. The court's decision applies to 25 Myanmar citizens wanted on charges linked to genocide and crimes against humanity. The list includes not only Myanmar's military leader Min Aung Hlaing, but also former State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and former President Htin Kyaw. Suu Kyi effectively served as Myanmar's top civilian leader before the military staged a coup in February 2021. She has been imprisoned ever since. The court in Argentina claims it has the jurisdiction to order a warrant for Suu Kyi's arrest based on a legal principle that some serious crimes can be prosecuted regardless of where they were committed. The specific case focuses on discrimination against Myanmar's Rohingya ethnic minority. The Muslim Rohingya live predominantly in the western state of Rakhine, and their status as citizens and as an ethnic group recognized by the state of Myanmar has been disputed for decades. The Rohingya crisis of 2017 Since 1988, Myanmar has seen an ongoing political conflict between the military and military-backed parties on one side and Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, on the other. In 2016, after many years of stalemate, the military and Aung San Suu Kyi reached a truce. A kind of dual government was established, with Aung San Suu Kyi heading the civilian branch and Min Aung Hlaing heading the military, which had constitutionally secured independence and far-reaching political rights. On October 9, 2016, Rohingya insurgents attacked several border and police posts of the Myanmar security forces. In August 2017, the security forces launched so-called clearance operations. As a result, thousands of Rohingya were killed and around 700,000 fled to neighboring Bangladesh, with exact figures still unclear due to the nature of the ethnically-charged conflict. Rohingya refugees fear increased hardship due to aid cutsTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video While the military denied using excessive force, international watchdogs and the UN agree that Myanmar's actions against the Rohingya constitute grave human rights violations. Still, two questions remain: First, did the offensive amount to genocide? Second, how much of it was the responsibility of Aung San Suu Kyi? The question of genocide Concerns that a genocide was happening in Myanmar have already been voiced before 2017. In 2015, the human rights organization Fortify Rights published a report with the Allard K. Lovenstein International Human Rights Clinic from Yale Law School in which was stated that there is strong evidence that genocide is being committed against Rohingya. Those voices only grew louder after 2017, and in November 2019, Gambia initiated a case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Myanmar, claiming violations of the UN's Genocide Convention. The ICJ has yet to rule on the case, however, meaning that the existence of genocide remains unconfirmed in a legal sense. But for human rights organizations like Fortify Rights, the Burmese-Rohingya Organization UK (BROUK) and the former UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar, Tomas Ojea Quintana, there is no doubt that genocide did take place. Quintana, an Argentinian, told Radio Free Asia that the court in his native country understood what was at stake, which is the genocide against the Rohingya people. The question of responsibility Aung San Suu Kyi was a globally renowned human rights advocate since the early 1990s until the events of 2017. She was also heading Myanmar's civilian government during the deadly wave of violence against the Rohingya. As chief councilor, she was notably hesitant to speak out against the military and even went to The Hague in 2019 to defend Myanmar at the International Court of Justice. She denied genocide was happening in Rakhine but admitted human rights violations, which would be investigated by Myanmar. She later confirmed this position in an interview with the Financial Times. War crimes were committed during the internal armed conflict with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army by members of Myanmar's security forces and civilians, she told the paper. At the same time, Aung San Suu Kyi pointed to a report by the Independent Commission of Enquiry (ICOE) which was set up by Myanmar without Rohingya representatives. The ICOE found no evidence of genocide, she told the paper, despite its report recording killing of civilians, disproportionate use of force, looting of property, and destruction of abandoned homes of Muslims. For those who believe Myanmar troops committed genocide against the Rohingya, Aung San Suu Kyi's refusal to recognize it makes her complicit. But does her stance — admitting that human rights violations happened but not genocide — mean Aung San Suu Kyi is guilty of committing genocide? What do we know about the Argentinian court order? The reasons behind the Argentinian court's decision to seek an international arrest warrant are not fully clear, as neither the ruling nor the exact evidence on which the ruling was based are publicly available. DW contacted the Argentinian court and the Argentinian human rights commission to get more information in the matter, but received no reply. The 2021 coup triggered protests in Myanmar, which eventually escalated into a civil war.Image: Sai Aung Main/AFP In the months following the announcement, Myanmar expert and former ambassador Derek Tonkin published an academic paper on the issue, examining the sources which most likely led to the arrest warrant. He writes that the petition [on which the decision of the court seems to be based] contains much narrative and opinion which are debatable and questionable, and in some areas are simply wrong. Commenting on the claim that Aung San Suu Kyi and others validated the genocide against the Rohingya, Tonkin states, it is not true and is supported by no evidence anywhere in the petition. Tonkin also rejects the accusation that Aung San Suu Kyi was directly responsible for the events in Rakhine State during her time as state counsellor at the time. I find this totally unconvincing. The Tatmadaw [the Myanmar military] refused to accept Aung San Suu Kyi's appointment, he writes. So far, the arrest warrant hasn't had any impact. Aung San Suu Kyi seems set to celebrate her 80th birthday next month as a prisoner in Myanmar as the civil war rages on. With the passage of time, the international arrest warrant might end up as a mere footnote in a long political career filled with legal battles.

As soon as Khalid reached Bihar, though, his wife, Shama Qadri, got a ransom call, saying he had been kidnapped. Though Khalid returned safely after the ransom was paid, it was three clues that led the Thane police to arrest the accused: two papaya trees, the voice of a muezzin, and the mobile network of a Nepal service provider. According to the Thane police, Qadri’s friend Noor Alam called him to Bihar on July 30, 2016, on the pretext of a land deal and then kidnapped him, along with his accomplices. Alam then allegedly made an extortion call to Shama, seeking ransom. In Mumbra, a worried Shama approached the police, following which a kidnapping case was registered. To ensure Khalid’s safety, Shama paid Rs 30 lakh, after which he was allowed to return to Mumbra on August 5, 2016. Back home, Qadri met Thane Crime Branch officials, who asked if he remembered anything about where he was held captive. According to a police officer, Qadri told them that the room he was in was situated near a mosque, as he could hear a muezzin’s call for prayers five times a day. He had also seen two papaya trees at a distance, he said. The other clue that the police had was that the accused had used a Nepal-based mobile service provider to make ransom calls. This had confused the investigating officials as the calls had been traced to Bihar. When a police team reached the area from where the ransom call was made, however, they found that it had access to the mobile network of a Nepal-based service provider as well. The police thus narrowed down their search to a few villages in the vicinity. Khalid had told the police that he would be able to identify the muezzin’s voice if he heard it again. The police team then started visiting the villages in the area at different prayer times. After visiting a couple of mosques, Khalid identified a voice as the one he had heard when in captivity. “Near the mosque, we found two papaya trees. We then tracked the room where he had been detained,” an officer recalled. The police found that the room was owned by one of the accused, who resided nearby. The police then laid a trap and arrested the main accused, Noor Alam, 30, and his alleged aides, Saifiullah Khan, 45, and Irfan Khan, 22. The police also recovered the ransom money that had been paid.",13cab08f1797db8c5bed7c0040541cdbdfe2a7d57a736047bea47af16a6df6f1,57b4b4788b1f3cf39e957b14ca8dc114

They identified the deceased as Sandeep and Arif, residents of the B block area in Khayala. According to the police, a call was received from Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hospital to the Khayala police station about two men admitted with stab injuries between 10 pm and 11 pm. They both succumbed to injuries in the early hours of Monday. “As per the information available so far, two friends, who have known each other for years, were sitting in the park. An argument over something started between them, and it escalated to a scuffle. During the brawl, both of them stabbed each other using sharp-edged weapons,” said Vichitra Veer, Deputy Commissioner of Police, West. According to a police officer, neighbours saw the men lying injured in the park and rushed them to the hospital. Sandeep worked as a property dealer and previously as a gym trainer, said the police, adding that both men were married and had children. The park where the two were sitting was under the jurisdiction of Tilak Nagar police station. Teams from both Khayala and Tilak Nagar stations are now investigating the matter. The police are now questioning the neighbours and family members of the deceased to find the cause of the conflict between the two. They are reviewing CCTV footage from the area to establish the sequence of events. The bodies have been preserved for postmortem at the DDU Hospital Monday. Meanwhile, the Delhi Police crime data shows that 107 cases of murder were reported between January 1 and March 31 in 2025, a slight uptick from 105 in 2024 during the same period, but lower than 2023, when it was 115.

Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Mohali Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Harmandeep Singh Hans, said several special teams were constituted to trace the rising number of heinous crimes in the district. The operation was led by SP (Operations) Talwinder Singh, SP (PBI) Deepika Singh, DSP (City-2) Harsimran Singh Bal, and DSP (Economic Offences) Rajesh. Under this operation SHO Amandeep Singh and inspectors Gabbar Singh and Gagandeep carried out an investigation based on an FIR registered on July 12. According to the complainant, the incident occurred during the night of July 11–12, when she was returning from Best Tech Mall after watching a movie with her friend. Near Lakhnour turn, four bike-borne youths, dressed in Nihang attire, intercepted their car. The miscreants forcibly dragged her out of the vehicle and kidnapped her friend before fleeing the scene in the stolen car, the complaint stated. The SSP said that after assaulting the kidnapped boy, the accused threw him about 100 meters away. They then fled with the girl, kept her with them for approximately 30 minutes and later pushed her out near a gate before escaping towards Ambala. SSP Hans identified the arrested accused as Shamsher Singh, a resident of Gurdaspur; Satnam Singh (from Ludhiana), who works as a cab driver; Nirmal Singh (Nawanshahr), employed as a security guard; and Chander Mohan, alias Jaildar (Jammu), who also works as a security guard, All four were residing at a PG located behind Gurdwara Singh Shaheedan, Sohana in Mohali. Acting on a tip-off, police put the entire district on high alert. Multiple teams were deployed and after analysing the CCTV footage, the stolen vehicle was successfully traced. The accused were arrested from Chanarthal village under Sahabad police station, and the looted car was recovered. “These accused may be involved in other criminal cases as well. Interrogation is underway, and more revelations are expected,” Hans added.",7f251a7091a932c843ffae68035733e3ed5734782bce2e0aba302a91473a43d5,e9ffc2dbb5d1b5a0c5b8fd59dc708464

Sanjay Verma was shot dead on Monday at around 10 am, right outside his showroom in Abohar. According to eyewitnesses, three motorcycle-borne assailants lay in wait for him. The moment Verma stepped out of his car, they opened indiscriminate fire, killing him on the spot before fleeing the scene. While the shooters escaped and have yet to be identified, the Punjab Police announced the arrest of two of their accomplices, Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan, both residents of Patiala district, for helping the shooters escape in the car. However, within hours, both men were killed in a police encounter. This development has added fuel to the controversy. BJP General Secretary Manjinder Singh Sirsa accused the Punjab government of mishandling the law and order situation. On his visit to Chandigarh Wednesday, Sirsa said, “First of all, the Punjab government is not able to control the law and order and criminals… Punjab has become a police state. If Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has a clean image, he should get a CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) inquiry conducted into these encounters so the truth comes out.” Reacting sharply, AAP’s Punjab state president Aman Arora called the BJP’s stance “extremely shameful,” accusing it of siding with gangsters instead of supporting Verma’s bereaved family. Arora said, “While the entire Punjab stands with the family of Shri Sanjay Verma, Manjinder Singh Sirsa’s open support for gangsters today proves that the BJP is backing criminals even through central jails.” After meeting the family of Sanjay Verma on Monday, Arora had stated that gangsters lodged in jails outside Punjab were behind such heinous criminal activities. Whereas, Union Minister of State Ravneet Singh Bittu held the Mann government responsible for the ‘growing fear and lawlessness’ across Punjab. “Instead of owning up to their failure, AAP leaders are shamelessly pointing fingers at the Centre. This is not governance –it’s a complete abdication of duty,” he added. Bittu called Arora’s remarks “irresponsible” and “highly condemnable,” accusing him of trying to deflect attention from the AAP government’s failure to maintain law and order in the state. In a statement released on Monday, Bittu announced that he would write to the Governor of Punjab, urging him to take cognisance of Arora’s “baseless allegations”. He also sought written clarifications from Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav and Chief Secretary KAP Sinha, questioning whether Arora’s statement reflected the official position of the Bhagwant Mann-led government. “Aman Arora’s claim that gangster Lawrence Bishnoi is safe in Gujarat under the Centre’s protection is nothing but an excuse to hide the AAP government’s incompetence. These kinds of inflammatory and misleading remarks are both dangerous and unacceptable,” said Bittu. He reaffirmed that the central government has always taken a tough stance against terrorism and organised crime. “We conducted surgical strikes inside Pakistan when needed. Do you think gangsters are beyond our reach? Once the BJP forms government in Punjab, we’ll show what decisive action really looks like,” Bittu said. Pointing to the killing of Sanjay Verma, Bittu accused the Punjab government of completely surrendering to the gangster nexus. “Extortion threats and targeted killings have become the new normal for Punjab’s business community,” he said. Adding to the political slugfest, AAP’s Abohar constituency in-charge Arun Narang displayed a photo showing Abohar MLA Sandeep Jakhar with Shakti, a bike driver allegedly linked to the murder. Sandeep Jakhar, who is a suspended Congress MLA and nephew of Punjab BJP chief Sunil Jakhar, clarified that the picture was from the 2022 assembly election campaign. “Many people get pictures taken with us during campaigns. It’s illogical to link that picture to this crime,” he said. ‘We have full trust’ Jagat Verma, elder brother of Sanjay Verma, has expressed satisfaction over the police probe. In a video, Jagat Verma said, “We have full trust in the Punjab Police and we are satisfied with the ongoing police investigation. We humbly appeal to one and all to please stop doing politics over this issue. We appeal to the police to nab the rest of the culprits soon… We trust that we will get justice soon.” State of probe The police said their investigations have revealed that the getaway bike was driven by one Shakti, a daily wager from Azimgarh village of Abohar. While escaping, the attackers lost control of their bike and forcibly snatched another two-wheeler. They later abandoned it on Seeto Road and allegedly fled in a waiting Swift car, driven by Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan. Jaspreet Singh’s family has denied any involvement, alleging that he was picked up from his house in Mardankheri village of Patiala during the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday, and that they later received news of his death. They maintain that Jaspreet was a daily wager with no criminal background. The police said Jaspreet had a criminal background, and released a few pictures of him brandishing weapons. The details of his criminal record haven’t been revealed as of now. At the time of filing this report, the postmortem examination of Jaspreet and Ram was underway at the Abohar Civil Hospital under strict police cover. Meanwhile, gangster Aarzoo Bishnoi had claimed responsibility for the murder on social media, tagging Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar and Maharashtra’s Shivam Lonker hours after the murder. After the alleged encounter, Bishnoi again posted that the real shooters remained at large, and that Jaspreet Singh and Ram Rattan had no role in the killing.

Their online conversations quickly grew into what seemed like a genuine relationship, and soon, talks of marriage followed. But the connection, which appeared to promise a shared future, turned out to be an elaborate cyber scam in which he was allegedly duped of a staggering Rs 1.55 crore over eight months. The investigation revealed that the cybercriminals, operating behind the profile of ‘Anamika,’ gradually gained the complainant’s trust and allegedly requested large sums of money. On the pretence of building a future together, ‘Anamika’ allegedly convinced him to transfer funds to purchase a house without ever having met. Over time, the scammers further manipulated him into investing in various trading apps, luring him with promises of exceptionally high returns, said the police. After spending nearly all his life savings and facing further demands for more money, he realised he had been deceived. When he tried to recover his funds, ‘Anamika’ allegedly abruptly stopped all communication with him. The police filed an FIR in March based on his complaint. The investigation by the cybercrime police station in Pimpri Chinchwad unearthed an elaborate network of mule account handlers allegedly operating from Solapur and with links to cybercriminals masterminding these scams from China. The police zeroed in on one particular mule account registered in Solapur in June. As the account holder was questioned, he spilled the beans on three others from Solapur who had allegedly told him that his bank account would be used for taking funds obtained from gaming applications. As the investigation dug deeper into these three suspects, the police established their identities and roles in the racket. The mule account handlers from Solapur have been identified as Shubham Chandrakant Mantha, 25, a resident of Ashok Chowk; Swapnil Chandulal Baheti, 35, a resident of Hotgi Road; and Prashik Uttam Navghare, 26, a resident of Juna Kumbhani Naka. “Our investigation revealed that Mantha worked for a China-headquartered payment application company, and he and Baheti were in direct contact with the masterminds based out of China. A coordinated search operation was launched for the trio as their roles were confirmed in the probe,” an officer who was part of the probe said. In the second week of June, Mantha and Navghare were arrested from Pune International Airport when they were about to flee to Nepal via Patna. Baheti, too, was placed under arrest. “Investigation revealed an elaborate mule handling and fund siphoning operation with direct links to China,” said an officer. All three suspects are currently in judicial custody.

The victim, identified as Sanjeev, 19, a resident of Rajiv Colony, Panchkula, had reportedly come to the area to meet a friend when he was attacked. According to police officials, Sanjeev was surrounded by three to four individuals around 10.30 pm. He was stabbed multiple times in the chest and abdomen with a knife, and then left critically injured on the roadside. The assailants fled the scene immediately after the attack. Soon after, a crowd gathered at the spot, and the PCR was informed. Sanjeev was rushed to the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, Chandigarh, where he succumbed to his injuries during treatment, the police said. The Chandigarh Police have apprehended two minors in connection with the crime. “An FIR has been registered, and the two juveniles have been booked for murder. They will be sent to a juvenile home,” said Vijay Singh, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Chandigarh Police. Sources revealed that the accused allegedly attacked Sanjeev because he was reportedly stalking their sister. The police have not ruled out the involvement of more individuals and are continuing their investigation. Meanwhile, the preliminary postmortem report has stated that the victim died due to punctured vital organs caused by the stabbings. The incident has triggered tension in the area, with residents demanding increased police patrolling and swift justice. Teenager injured in stabbing attack in Sector 40 A 19-year-old teenager was critically injured in a targeted stabbing attack by a group of around half a dozen minors in Block C of Sector 40 in Chandigarh on Sunday night. The assault is suspected to be a result of personal enmity. According to the police, the attackers arrived on three to four motorbikes and were not wearing helmets. They attacked the youth and fled the scene within seconds. The victim was initially rushed by his family members to a private hospital in Mohali, but was later shifted to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, Chandigarh. Chiranji Lal, Station House Officer (SHO), Sector-39 Police Station, confirmed that the attack appeared to be premeditated and due to a personal dispute. The condition of the victim is stable, he added. Efforts are underway to trace the suspects. The accused are all minors, said the SHO.",b0d6e7aff031ee66a6a91c3cfe94f608d6d756f573b6c8344e68aa9c40b83612,a974bdead49b7c89b18ff058176c3d87

But when public figures cross legal lines, the consequences unfold not just in courtrooms but also under the relentless scrutiny of the public eye. One name that recently forced this uncomfortable truth into the spotlight is Sean “Diddy” Combs, the hip-hop mogul and music industry titan who, after years of whispers and lawsuits, has now been convicted in a federal court. In July 2025, a jury found Combs guilty on two felony counts of transportation to engage in prostitution under the Mann Act, a law dating back to 1910. These charges relate to the coerced travel of his former partner, singer Cassie Ventura, and another woman identified only as “Jane,” both of whom testified during the trial. Combs was acquitted on three other charges, including racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking. Still, the guilty verdict marks a seismic fall for the 55-year-old artist once synonymous with glamour, success, and cultural dominance. Diddy’s story is far from unique. Over the years, several A-listers have been convicted of crimes — from drug possession and assault to manslaughter and tax evasion. This listicle delves into 10 high-profile celebrities with criminal records, focusing only on those with confirmed legal outcomes. Once a towering figure in global music, Diddy’s legacy has been rocked by criminal convictions. In a 2025 federal trial, he was found guilty of two counts of transporting women – including ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura – for prostitution, under the Mann Act. Though acquitted of more serious charges like racketeering and sex trafficking, the felony convictions carry serious legal and reputational consequences. More fallout may follow. Attorney Tony Buzbee claims over 100 men and women have accused Diddy of rape and assault. One woman alleged she was gang raped at age 17 after being drugged at a 2003 party. While Combs’s team dismisses the lawsuits as publicity stunts, the convictions have added weight to the mounting allegations. Sanjay Dutt’s conviction remains one of the most talked-about legal sagas in Indian cinema. In 1993, following the devastating Mumbai bomb blasts, Dutt was arrested under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) for illegally possessing an AK-56 rifle, which was part of a consignment linked to the bombings. Though he was acquitted of terrorism charges, he was convicted in 2006 under the Arms Act for illegal possession of firearms. After years of legal proceedings and appeals, Dutt was sentenced to five years in prison and ultimately served over four years, including time at Yerwada Central Jail. Before becoming Tony Stark, Robert Downey Jr. was one of Hollywood’s most tragic cautionary tales. Struggling with addiction in the 90s, Downey was repeatedly arrested for possession of heroin, cocaine, and unlicensed firearms. He was famously found wandering into a neighbour’s house under the influence and passed out in their bed. In 1999, after multiple probation violations, he was sentenced to three years in prison, though he served roughly a year before early release. In 2009, Bollywood actor Shiney Ahuja was arrested for raping his domestic help—a case that sent shockwaves through the film industry. Though the victim later recanted her statement, the court found the original testimony credible and convicted Ahuja in 2011 under Section 376 (rape) and other charges. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, though he spent about three years in jail before being released on bail pending appeal. Wesley Snipes’ high-flying Hollywood career hit a wall when he was convicted in 2008 on three misdemeanor counts of failing to file federal income tax returns. Prosecutors claimed he hadn’t paid taxes for years, despite earning tens of millions. Though he was acquitted of the more severe felony tax fraud charges, he still served nearly three years in prison. In 1992, boxing champion Mike Tyson was convicted of raping 18-year-old Desiree Washington, a beauty pageant contestant, in an incident that took place at a hotel in Indianapolis in July 1991. The jury found Tyson guilty after about 10 hours of deliberation, rejecting his defense that the encounter was consensual. Tyson was sentenced to six years in prison and served approximately three years before being released on parole in 1995. The conviction shocked the sports world and dramatically altered Tyson’s public image overnight, marking a significant turning point in his career. Despite this setback, Tyson later returned to the boxing ring and expanded his career into entertainment, including notable acting roles such as in The Hangover film series. In 2001, Stranger Things star Winona Ryder was arrested for shoplifting over $5,500 worth of merchandise from a Beverly Hills Saks Fifth Avenue store. She was later convicted of felony grand theft and vandalism, receiving three years’ probation, 480 hours of community service, and fines. The incident damaged her career for years, leading to a hiatus from leading roles in Hollywood. Ryder eventually made a well-received comeback, and her 2000s-era troubles are now often seen as part of the conversation around mental health and celebrity pressure. Shia LaBeouf is known for his acting talent as well as his history of erratic behaviour and legal troubles. Over the years, he has been arrested multiple times for offenses such as disorderly conduct, public intoxication, and drunk driving. One of the most notable incidents occurred in 2017, when LaBeouf was arrested in Savannah, Georgia, for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. During this arrest, he was caught on camera making a racially charged outburst toward police officers. These incidents, along with other arrests for similar behavior, have contributed to his reputation for instability. LaBeouf has also faced civil lawsuits from former partners, most prominently from singer FKA Twigs, who accused him of sexual battery and emotional abuse. While he has not been criminally convicted in these civil cases, the combination of his legal issues and public controversies has overshadowed his career achievements, leading many to view him as a cautionary example of wasted potential in Hollywood. Before becoming a blockbuster actor and producer, Mark Wahlberg had a violent and troubling past. At 16, Wahlberg was charged with attempted murder after assaulting two Vietnamese men during a racially motivated attack. He was convicted of assault and served 45 days in prison. The case drew renewed attention in 2014 when Wahlberg applied for a pardon, sparking criticism from civil rights groups and raising questions about accountability and privilege. Wahlberg has publicly acknowledged his past and expressed remorse, though his request for a pardon was ultimately dropped. Phil Spector, the music genius behind the Wall of Sound, became infamous for a far more sinister reason. In 2009, he was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2003 death of actress Lana Clarkson, who was found shot in his mansion. The trial, his second, after a hung jury, ended in a conviction and a 19-years-to-life prison sentence. Spector died in custody in 2021.",73697cd66a0be055d4dc8648c5cf018f30e228abbd24ff6c1604b1ab6fa4aac5,1676ed0148c17932b20d45559413e540

The doctor received two bullet injuries, and his condition is critical, they said. Ajay Gandhi, Senior Superintendent of Police, Moga, said Dr Aniljit Kamboj, who is in his fifties, was shot at by two men who came to his Harbans Nursing Home at around 2 pm. “The doctor was treating one of them, and discussing medicines when the second man who was standing behind opened fire. Two bullets hit the doctor, including one in the chest. He has been admitted to a private hospital in Moga, and his condition is critical. He is on ventilator,” Gandhi told The Indian Express. He said the police are probing the case from all angles, and checking CCTV footage to identify the suspects. A family member told The Indian Express that Kamboj had received extortion calls from Canada-based designated terrorist Lakhbir Singh Landa, an operative of the banned organization Babbar Khalsa International (BKI). The threat calls were being received since 2022 and the caller was demanding at least Rs 1 crore, said the family member, requesting anonymity. He further said that Kamboj was also given a security cover by the Moga Police but the lone gunman was withdrawn some months ago. Moga SP (investigation) Bal Krishan Singla, said: “An FIR was registered in 2022 after Dr Kamboj had received threat calls. Landa was nominated as an accused in that FIR. However, the family did not inform us about any such latest incident.” Asked if the security cover was withdrawn, he said: “They were having the security cover till some time ago but currently, they had no such threat perception.

The police said that the triple murders were in retaliation to a killing that occurred in November last year in connection with a feud between two families who belong to the same village.

To avenge Talikot’s death, four of his brothers along with associates reportedly orchestrated Wednesday’s attack, the police said. “The police have been warning the families after the murder that took place last year. They belong to the same caste and are relatives. We suspect that these murders were carried out in revenge,” said Kalaburagi City Police Commissioner Sharanappa S D on Thursday.

Some acted as initial recruiters, even while the babies were still in the womb, while others were responsible for caring for the babies, housing them, and producing fake identity documents such as birth certificates. All but one of the arrested suspects were female.Babies sold online in IndonesiaPhoto shows Two women crying while hugging a baby boy.An infant was allegedly sold by his father to a married couple desperate to have children in one of the latest cases of baby trafficking in Indonesia.According to police, the investigation began after a parent reported that their baby was kidnapped.But it was later discovered the parents had agreed to sell the baby, but were not paid. One of the parents planned to sell the baby, but because they were not paid, the other parent reported it as a kidnapping, Commissioner Surawan told CNN Indonesia.The majority of the babies were from Bandung but were transported to Pontianak, where police found fake identity documents. That's where the babies were added to other people's family cards, and then other documents were created, including passports, Commissioner Surawan added.Financially drivenPolice said the alleged offenders bought babies directly from mothers for amounts between 11 million and 16 million rupiah ($1,000 to $1,500).Police also found that parents who wanted to give up their babies were offered compensation, which included the cost of childbirth.Commissioner Hendra Rochmawan says police rescued six babies from the baby-trafficking syndicate. (Supplied: Humas Polri)Last year, an Indonesian man was charged after allegedly selling his child on Facebook for less than $1,500.Police found the father to be financially motivated because he was involved in online gambling.Most of the babies discovered in the recent sting were from West Java, the province with the second-highest poverty rate in Indonesia.According to data from the National Socio-Economic Survey released early this year, an estimated 3.67 million people in West Java lived below the poverty line.Baby sellers caught using Instagram to broker deals in IndonesiaPhoto shows An Instagram post advertising a baby for adoption with a black and white picture of a baby.Four people are arrested after allegedly selling babies via an Instagram account, local police say.The deputy mayor of Bandung city urged hospitals to strictly monitor mothers who had just given birth.

Procedures for naming babies, assigning identification tags, and monitoring people entering and leaving must also be reviewed, said Deputy Mayor Erwin, who goes by one name.There was no official data on the number of babies and kids being sold in Indonesia, but the Child Protection Commission told the ABC that reports and complaints related to child exploitation and trafficking had increased.The commission also said that a lack of economic subsidies for struggling families and information about legal adoption contributed to baby trafficking in Indonesia.The commission urged the Indonesian government to provide more financial assistance for raising children and childbirth, which can be cost-prohibitive for some parents.The Indonesian police said they would liaise with Interpol to track down the babies who were sold in Singapore.Posted 19h ago19 hours agoThu 17 Jul 2025 at 6:38amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Counselling and support services1800 Respect, National counselling helpline: 1800 737 732Bravehearts, counselling and support for survivors of child sexual abuse: 1800 272 831Child Wise, counselling provider: 1800 991 099Lifeline, 24-hour crisis support and suicide prevention: 13 11 14Care Leavers Australia Network: 1800 008 774PartnerSPEAK, peer support for non-offending partners: (03) 9018 7872Find support services in your state or territory.Top StoriesSurfers' alleged killers face Mexican court as document reveals cartel claimsTopic:HomicidePhoto shows Jake and Callum Robinson stand next to each other and smile.Trump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseBREAKINGPhoto shows A middle-aged man with grey-white hair wearing a grey T-shirt looks serious in front of a plain background.USAID returns Australian aid money after DFAT requestTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows USAID logoForcing companies to delete data would remove cybercrime 'honey pot', experts sayTopic:Cyber CrimePhoto shows A hooded man holds a laptop computer as cyber code is projected on him.Lachlan Young pleads guilty to murder of Hannah McGuireBREAKINGPhoto shows Sketch of a man with short hair, a white shirt and a black tie.Related stories'I want my husband to be punished': Indonesian police say a dad sold his 11-month-old baby to fund gamblingTopic:Child AbusePhoto shows Two women crying while hugging a baby boy.Related topicsAsiaChild AbuseCrimeHuman TraffickingIndonesiaPoliceSingaporeTop StoriesSurfers' alleged killers face Mexican court as document reveals cartel claimsTopic:HomicidePhoto shows Jake and Callum Robinson stand next to each other and smile.Breaking: Trump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseTopic:CourtsUSAID returns Australian aid money after DFAT requestTopic:Federal GovernmentForcing companies to delete data would remove cybercrime 'honey pot', experts sayTopic:Cyber CrimeBreaking: Lachlan Young pleads guilty to murder of Hannah McGuireTopic:CourtsJust InLarapinta Trail hikers urged caution after two rescues in one weekTopic:Hiking15m ago15 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:45amQueensland man charged with illegally importing hundreds of gun parts from USTopic:Law, Crime and Justice9m ago9 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:51amTrump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseBREAKING5m ago5 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:55amYouth camp founder Geoffrey Guest on trial for child sexual assaultTopic:Courts32m ago32 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:28amMore Just InBack to top Surfers' alleged killers face Mexican court as document reveals cartel claimsTopic:HomicidePhoto shows Jake and Callum Robinson stand next to each other and smile.

(ABC News)In short:Payment processing company EFTEX will stop facilitating transactions from ATMs situated inside tobacco stores and other high-risk businesses.It comes after an ABC investigation revealed major private ATM suppliers were targeting the illegal tobacco industry.What's next?Financial crime expert Neil Browne says it is a step in the right direction, and he would like to see more payment providers follow suit.abc.net.au/news/tobacconist-atms-cut-off-payment-networks-eftex/105539942Link copiedShareShare articleOne of Australia's major payment processors will stop handling transactions from private ATMs sited in tobacco shops and will demand detailed information about the machine owners.New South Wales-based EFTEX, which processes transactions for more than 5,500 ATMs, this week told clients that media coverage about ATMs in high-risk environments like tobacco stores had triggered increased regulatory scrutiny.Some small tobacco stores were found hosting two ATMs to meet the cash demand. (ABC News)The move follows an ABC investigation revealing major private ATM suppliers were fuelling the illegal tobacco industry, placing their machines in tobacconists where they provided an instant source of cash for off the books transactions.Some tiny stores selling illegal tobacco even hosted two machines concurrently to cope with the huge demand for cash that fuels a black-market trade.Payment processing company EFTEX has stopped handling transactions from ATMs in tobacco shops.The ABC also revealed that criminals, including a drug dealer, were able to own and operate the private ATMs, which offer money laundering opportunities when merchants were able to load them with their proceeds of crime.EFTEX said — in conjunction with partners Big Four banks Westpac and ANZ — this meant it would stop processing payments from ATMs in tobacconists. It would also cull services to other high risk business operations like the adult entertainment industry from September 15.The changes mark a step in the ATM industry, whose backers include prestigious investment bank Macquarie Group, to divorce itself from the illicit sector.EFTEX says the decision was made amid increased regulatory scrutiny following the ABC's investigation. (ABC News)'Increased media coverage'EFTEX, which helps process payments for ATM companies, this week told clients about an upcoming crackdown. As you are aware there has been increased media coverage of independent ATM operators with ATMs located in high-risk environments, it said in correspondence sighted by the ABC. This is leading to increased regulatory scrutiny. In response EFTEX and its acquiring partners have agreed to cease processing ATM transactions linked to high-risk locations that include but are not limited to tobacconists and adult entertainment venues. EFTEX also warned it would be seeking detailed information about client's business structures including the identity of owners, as part of its anti-money laundering duties. This will include information on directors, owners' franchises, sub-ATM deployers (businesses deploying private ATMs) and cash providers etc,'' said the correspondence.'Understanding underlying risks'Financial crime compliance expert Neil Browne said the move was absolutely a step in the right direction and should be replicated across the industry. EFTEX is beginning to understand who its customers are and any underlying risks associated with those customers,'' said Mr Browne. Other providers should be taking similar steps .Neil Browne says other payment processing companies should follow EFTEX's example.

(Supplied: Australian Federal Police)In May, the JCCT released CCTV footage of three people getting out of an alleged stolen VW Golf, with two seen pouring the contents of several jerry cans into the synagogue and setting the liquid alight.The car — which investigators at the time came to refer to as an alleged communal crime car — then drove off towards the western suburbs.Police allege the car was stolen from Croydon, in Melbourne's outer east, and was also used in an arson attack on the Lux nightclub in South Yarra in November.It's alleged the car was also used in an arson and shooting in Bundoora, in the city's north-east, on the same night as the synagogue attack.Police allege the man stole the car a week before the synagogue attack.

Until we find those who are ultimately directing these violent crimes, we have no prospect of stopping them or delivering justice for the victims.

(AAP)After news of Murdoch's death broke, Central Queensland University criminologist Xanthe Mallett said, a lot can have changed in almost a quarter of a century, and people may now be able to speak that couldn't at the time . There's always the chance that Bradley Murdoch would have shared some information, and people wouldn't have been able to share that until he's dead, so this may be an opportunity, she said. I'm hoping that people out there do know something. Dr Mallett said DNA could remain active for decades depending on exactly how they've been left , making it possible to identify Mr Falconio if a new lead were to reveal his final resting place.Xanthe Mallett says she will be surprised if we find him, sadly due to the scale of the territory which the police would have to cover . (ABC Newcastle: Romy Stephens) If human remains are found in the bush … whomever they are, if they're human remains, it's likely that they will be able to get DNA from them, either from the bones or from the teeth, she said. So if that person's DNA is on record, as I'm sure Peter's would be, then you could do a match to those remains. It's finding those remains in the first place that is going to be the key challenge. NT Police 'committed' to solving cold caseIn a statement acknowledging Murdoch's death, the Northern Territory Police Force said it was deeply regrettable that Murdoch has died without, as far as we are aware, ever disclosing the location of Peter Falconio's remains .First cop on scene of Falconio case recalls 'bizarre' tip-off from truckiePhoto shows A woman in a police uniform, leaving against a wooden edge.A sergeant who responded to the bizarre dead-of-night call about Peter Falconio and Joanne Lees being ambushed in remote NT has spoken exclusively with the ABC. The Northern Territory Police Force remains committed to resolving this final piece of the investigation, it said. We continue to appeal to anyone who may have information that could lead us to Peter Falconio's remains to come forward, no matter how small the detail may seem. Last month, NT Police announced a $500,000 reward for information leading to the discovery of Mr Falconio's remains, saying investigators still hold out hope of finding his body.Mark Grieve announced in June NT Police would double the reward for information leading to Mr Falconio's remains to $500,000. (ABC News: Samantha Dick) There may be someone out there that he's confided in — whether that's family and friends — we just don't know, Acting Commander Mark Grieve said in June. It's a good opportunity for us to up the ante in regards to the reward. We think there's still people out there that may hold some information. On Wednesday, an NT Police spokesperson said investigators were yet to verify tips they had received since increasing the reward. The Northern Territory Police Force can confirm it has received information since the announcement of the reward; however, the information is yet to be verified, he said.Falconio's family 'still hold out hope'In a statement to the ABC, Peter's parents, Luciano and Joan Falconio, said they remained hopeful their son's final resting place would be found. We didn't have much faith, but we were hoping Bradley John Murdoch would reveal where Peter was before he died, they said. Even now we still hold out hope that his remains will be found. Joan and Luciano Falconio said their son Peter's life was cruelly taken away . (AAP: Paul Benjafield)Upon hearing the news of Murdoch's death, Falconio's parents said their first feeling was of relief . It's like a weight that's been lifted, they said. We are only forced to think about [Murdoch] now that he's died. We don't want to let him ruin our lives more than he already has. The awful thing is our family's future with Peter was cruelly taken away. Today, we instead focus on the three children we have left and our grandchildren. The family also expressed their profound thanks to the Northern Territory Police for the support and continuing efforts to investigate our son's murder .'Vast scale' of searchDuring Murdoch's sentencing in 2005, Chief Justice Brian Martin said the killer put Mr Falconio's body into his vehicle before dumping it somewhere between Alice Springs and Broome — a distance spanning almost 1,700 kilometres.Dr Mallett said, unlike some other no body cases , the scale of the territory which the police would have to cover meant recovering any remains would be challenging unless someone came forward.Bradley Murdoch was convicted of Mr Falconio's murder in 2005 but gave up any chance of parole by refusing to reveal where he left his remains. (Rob Hutchison: AAP) Next year it'll be the 25th anniversary [so] the likelihood of them finding Peter's remains without significant intelligence — which we were all hoping was going to come from Murdoch — it's going to be very difficult, she said. It's a huge area and, without more information as to where to look, I would be very surprised if we find him, sadly. Initial search efforts in July 2001 involved line and motorbike searches as well as aerial searches 60 kilometres north and south of the location where Mr Falconio was last seen alive.Extensive searches for Mr Falconio were again held in 2005.Former investigator of Falconio's murder speaks outPhoto shows A woman in a police uniform, speaking to media.The lead investigator of the 2001 murder of British backpacker Peter Falconio says she is not surprised, but disappointed his convicted killer Bradley John Murdoch never revealed the location of his remains.Dr Mallett said the increased scrutiny on the case after Murdoch's death would be a really difficult time for Peter's family . They would have been hoping that Bradley Murdoch would have had a change of heart, knowing that he was terminally ill, and would have shared information to help the police find Peter, she said. We have to remember Joanne Lees in all of this, too. She lost a partner, she was devastated, and she was vilified as a result of this case. So this will be a very hard time for people who knew and loved Peter, and I'm just sorry that they didn't get any answers before Bradley Murdoch died.

(ABC North Coast: Hannah Ross) This was quite a confronting scene in a very busy area and I want to acknowledge those members of the community who very bravely risked their own safety in front of their own families, Detective Inspector Zimmer said.He said those who intervened likely saved the man's life.Inspector Zimmer said police were hoping to speak with the alleged victim, who regained consciousness on Wednesday afternoon after being put in an induced coma at Gold Coast University Hospital.He said the alleged attacker remained under police guard at Tweed Valley Hospital with minor injuries and would most likely be facing charges once he was released.Police say the street was bustling with people when the alleged assault occurred opposite the town's main supermarket.

(ABC North Coast: Hannah Ross)Detective Inspector Zimmer said the two assaults were unrelated and had no bearing on the safety of Byron Bay as a whole. These are isolated incidents, so in terms of general community safety it has no impact of the general community, he said.After the June assault Byron Shire Mayor Sarah Ndiaye said the council would conduct an audit on areas of concern. Unfortunately Byron has always had a bit of an underbelly in that sense, where we do have a higher rate than we should, or want to, of assaults, she said.Federal Member for Richmond Justine Elliot has promised $1 million each for the Byron, Tweed and Ballina shires to spend on security measures.Cr Ndiaye said she wanted part of the funding to spent on lighting and cameras in the car park where the assault occurred.Posted Wed 16 Jul 2025 at 8:52amWednesday 16 Jul 2025 at 8:52amWed 16 Jul 2025 at 8:52amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesSurfers' alleged killers face Mexican court as document reveals cartel claimsTopic:HomicidePhoto shows Jake and Callum Robinson stand next to each other and smile.Trump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseBREAKINGPhoto shows A middle-aged man with grey-white hair wearing a grey T-shirt looks serious in front of a plain background.USAID returns Australian aid money after DFAT requestTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows USAID logoForcing companies to delete data would remove cybercrime 'honey pot', experts sayTopic:Cyber CrimePhoto shows A hooded man holds a laptop computer as cyber code is projected on him.Lachlan Young pleads guilty to murder of Hannah McGuireBREAKINGPhoto shows Sketch of a man with short hair, a white shirt and a black tie.Popular nowTrump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseBREAKINGPhoto shows A middle-aged man with grey-white hair wearing a grey T-shirt looks serious in front of a plain background.Lachlan Young pleads guilty to murder of Hannah McGuireBREAKINGPhoto shows Sketch of a man with short hair, a white shirt and a black tie.First stop Westfield: Salim Mehajer released from jailTopic:CrimePhoto shows Convicted criminal and former deputy mayor Salim Mehajer inside Westfield Parramatta today.Related topicsByron BayCrimeLismoreTop StoriesSurfers' alleged killers face Mexican court as document reveals cartel claimsTopic:HomicidePhoto shows Jake and Callum Robinson stand next to each other and smile.Breaking: Trump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseTopic:CourtsUSAID returns Australian aid money after DFAT requestTopic:Federal GovernmentForcing companies to delete data would remove cybercrime 'honey pot', experts sayTopic:Cyber CrimeBreaking: Lachlan Young pleads guilty to murder of Hannah McGuireTopic:CourtsJust InLarapinta Trail hikers urged caution after two rescues in one weekTopic:Hiking16m ago16 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:45amQueensland man charged with illegally importing hundreds of gun parts from USTopic:Law, Crime and Justice9m ago9 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:51amTrump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseBREAKING6m ago6 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:55amYouth camp founder Geoffrey Guest on trial for child sexual assaultTopic:Courts32m ago32 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:28amMore Just InBack to top Surfers' alleged killers face Mexican court as document reveals cartel claimsTopic:HomicidePhoto shows Jake and Callum Robinson stand next to each other and smile.

(Supplied: AFP)The drugs were removed from the consignment which was delivered to a warehouse in Bowen Hills, in Brisbane's inner north.Australian Federal Police allege the three men were in the vicinity of the warehouse when it was delivered. Two of the men allegedly began to unravel the rolls of fabric, as the 24-year-old attended a business to buy an electronic scale to allegedly weigh the illicit drugs they were expecting, ABF and AFP said in a joint statement.Police said that during subsequent search warrants of the warehouse and two vehicles, investigators found and seized the contents of the consignment, four mobile phones, about $7,000 cash, and tools suspected to be used in accessing the methamphetamine.The AFP removed the illicit drugs and the consignment was delivered to a warehouse in Bowen Hills. (Supplied: AFP)AFP Detective Superintendent Adrian Telfer said police had not ruled out the possibility of further arrests being made. Our investigation into the syndicate allegedly responsible for attempting to bring these drugs into Australia is ongoing, he said.The men, aged 22, 24 and 28, from New South Wales have each been charged with one count of attempting to possess a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported border-controlled drug. Tony Nguyen and Ky Brendan did not appear in the Brisbane Magistrates Court when their matters were briefly heard for the first time on Wednesday.Martin Nguyen appeared via video link and applied for bail, but it was refused.All three were remanded in custody and their matters were adjourned until August.Border force officers say they uncovered 597kg of methamphetamine wrapped inside 200 rolls of fabric. (Supplied: AFP)Drugs concealed in 'kilometres' of fabricABF Acting Assistant Commissioner James Copeman said 200 metres of fabric was used for each of the 200 rolls. It is kilometres of fabric that they have used, he said. They have concealed, or attempted to smuggle, all of those smaller packages towards the end of that in the hope it would cause some sort of disruption to our x-ray technologies, of which it did not. Forensic testing found the shipment contained 597kg of methamphetamine wrapped inside 200 rolls of fabric. (Supplied: AFP)He said while concealing drugs in fabric was not a new methodology , this attempt was incredibly sophisticated . The sheer volume of methamphetamine hidden within legitimate-looking fabric rolls speaks to the lengths criminal syndicates will go to, but it also highlights the extraordinary capability of ABF officers to detect and disrupt even the most convincing smuggling attempts, Assistant Commissioner Copeman said.'Six million individual street deals'Detective Superintendent Telfer said the result demonstrated the commitment to combating transnational organised crime and illicit drug trafficking. The people behind importations like this have no regard for the harm and damage that illicit drugs wreak on the Australian community every minute of every day, he said. Methamphetamine is a devastating drug and causes harm not just to the user, but also their loved ones and the wider community. This amount of methamphetamine could have resulted in about six million individual street deals.

We remind the public that the reward for information relating to the disappearance of Peter Falconio has been recently increased. Murdoch was born in the small West Australian town of Northampton in 1958.His life before prison involved working as a mechanic, driving trucks and running drugs across outback Australia.He was 43 when he killed Mr Falconio.In 2001, Mr Falconio and his girlfriend, Joanne Lees, were exploring Central Australia together in what was supposed to be a memorable outback holiday.Joanne Lees and Peter Falconio during their trip to Australia. (AAP)The British tourists were travelling in a Kombi van at night along the Stuart Highway, about 10 kilometres north of Barrow Creek, when Murdoch gestured for them to pull over from his ute.Soon after Mr Falconio hopped out of the driver's seat to talk to Murdoch, a gunshot was heard.The black electrical cable handcuffs Murdoch used to bind Joanne Lees's hands behind her back. (Stringer: Reuters)Murdoch then assaulted Ms Lees, bound her wrists with cable ties and electrical tape and forced her into his vehicle.Ms Lees somehow managed to escape into nearby bushland, and Murdoch drove off into the darkness.Mr Falconio was never seen again.The Kombi van belonging to Joanne Lees and Peter Falconio. (David Gerhaty: Reuters)The 28-year-old's mysterious death ignited a wave of international media attention, partly inspiring the 2005 Australian horror film Wolf Creek.Mr Falconio's family and Ms Lees were thrust into the spotlight in both Australia and the United Kingdom, with Ms Lees subjected to particularly intense scrutiny.Twenty-four years after their son disappeared, parents Joan and Luciano Falconio still do not know what happened to his remains.Murdoch never revealed the location of the young man's body.An undated photo of Peter Falconio and Joanne Lees that was shown during the trial at the Supreme Court in Darwin. (AAP)Catching a killerDuring the early months of the police investigation, when hundreds of suspects were still being treated as persons of interest, there was a major breakthrough — a man reported he knew who did it.He gave the name of Bradley John Murdoch.Police moved quickly and took a DNA sample from Murdoch, who had been arrested in South Australia over allegations he abducted and raped a 12-year-old girl and her mother.The Crown case rested on Ms Lees's ability to identify Murdoch from photographs, as well as DNA evidence linking him to the crime using a blood sample taken from the scene.A police mugshot of Bradley John Murdoch. (Getty Images: Northern Territory Police)The item that ultimately condemned Murdoch was an elastic hair tie found in his ute that belonged to Ms Lees.Former NT police officer Colleen Gwynne, who was the lead investigator in the Falconio case, said an eagle-eyed police officer in her team had noticed the hair tie wrapped around Murdoch's holster while trawling through his belongings.Ms Gwynne told the ABC in 2016 that Murdoch probably didn't know how significant the hair tie was , and suggested he kept it as a trophy .Colleen Gwynne was the lead investigator on the Peter Falconio case. (Supplied)In 2005, Murdoch was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Mr Falconio and attempted kidnapping of Ms Lees, with a non-parole period of 28 years.The court heard Murdoch had put Mr Falconio's body into his ute before dumping it somewhere between Alice Springs and Broome.During sentencing, Chief Justice Brian Martin described Murdoch's offending as nothing short of cowardly in the extreme .He said Murdoch's prospects of rehabilitation were low given his complete lack of remorse and prior offending.Murdoch was acquitted of the rape allegations in South Australia in 2003, immediately before police arrested and charged him over the Falconio case.He had also served time in jail in WA in the mid-1990s for shooting at a crowd of Aboriginal football fans celebrating a victory in Fitzroy Crossing.Bradley John Murdoch being taken to the Darwin police watch house to be formally charged with murder. (AAP)During his two decades behind bars, Murdoch always maintained his innocence.He appealed to overturn his convictions twice, but was unsuccessful.In 2016, the NT government introduced no body, no parole laws with the aim of eliciting a confession from Murdoch by removing his right to parole in 2032.It did not work.This year, NT Police launched a fresh public appeal by offering a new reward of $500,000 for information on Mr Falconio's remains.Acting Commander Mark Grieve from NT Police's Crime and Intelligence Command previously stated in June that police had been speaking to Murdoch. On all occasions, he's chosen not to positively engage with police, he said.Murdoch was transferred to the Alice Springs Correctional Centre in 2022, after previously being housed at Darwin's Holtze prison.His death in custody will be subject to a mandatory coronial inquest.Posted Tue 15 Jul 2025 at 9:14pmTuesday 15 Jul 2025 at 9:14pmTue 15 Jul 2025 at 9:14pm, updated Tue 15 Jul 2025 at 10:22pmTuesday 15 Jul 2025 at 10:22pmTue 15 Jul 2025 at 10:22pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesSurfers' alleged killers face Mexican court as document reveals cartel claimsTopic:HomicidePhoto shows Jake and Callum Robinson stand next to each other and smile.Trump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseBREAKINGPhoto shows A middle-aged man with grey-white hair wearing a grey T-shirt looks serious in front of a plain background.USAID returns Australian aid money after DFAT requestTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows USAID logoForcing companies to delete data would remove cybercrime 'honey pot', experts sayTopic:Cyber CrimePhoto shows A hooded man holds a laptop computer as cyber code is projected on him.Lachlan Young pleads guilty to murder of Hannah McGuireBREAKINGPhoto shows Sketch of a man with short hair, a white shirt and a black tie.Popular nowTrump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseBREAKINGPhoto shows A middle-aged man with grey-white hair wearing a grey T-shirt looks serious in front of a plain background.Lachlan Young pleads guilty to murder of Hannah McGuireBREAKINGPhoto shows Sketch of a man with short hair, a white shirt and a black tie.First stop Westfield: Salim Mehajer released from jailTopic:CrimePhoto shows Convicted criminal and former deputy mayor Salim Mehajer inside Westfield Parramatta today.Related topicsAlice SpringsBroomeCrimeDarwinLaw, Crime and JusticePoliceTop StoriesSurfers' alleged killers face Mexican court as document reveals cartel claimsTopic:HomicidePhoto shows Jake and Callum Robinson stand next to each other and smile.Breaking: Trump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseTopic:CourtsUSAID returns Australian aid money after DFAT requestTopic:Federal GovernmentForcing companies to delete data would remove cybercrime 'honey pot', experts sayTopic:Cyber CrimeBreaking: Lachlan Young pleads guilty to murder of Hannah McGuireTopic:CourtsJust InLarapinta Trail hikers urged caution after two rescues in one weekTopic:Hiking15m ago15 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:45amQueensland man charged with illegally importing hundreds of gun parts from USTopic:Law, Crime and Justice9m ago9 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:51amTrump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseBREAKING5m ago5 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:55amYouth camp founder Geoffrey Guest on trial for child sexual assaultTopic:Courts32m ago32 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:28amMore Just InBack to top Surfers' alleged killers face Mexican court as document reveals cartel claimsTopic:HomicidePhoto shows Jake and Callum Robinson stand next to each other and smile.

Kylie Stott, Dimitri D'Elio and Danny Clarke pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, murder and arson in a nearly seven-week trial that heard from emergency services, DNA experts, police officers, and pathologists, and was described by a prosecutor as a case about retribution .The jury was shown photos taken by Victoria Police of the burnt car, which contained the remains of Charlie Gander's body.

The jury found Clarke, who was 38 at the time of offending, guilty of kidnapping and not guilty of murder, manslaughter and arson. All three accused were expressionless as the verdict was read to the court.The prosecution told the jury that the trio was motivated by a desire for revenge.

(Supplied: Gander family)Following a police raid in Shepparton in November 2022, Mr Gander gave a police interview and made a witness statement about Mr May possessing a firearm.Mr May was under a firearms prohibition order, Mr Gibson said.A disc with the record of Mr Gander's police interview found its way into the hands of others and cost Mr Gander dearly , Mr Gibson said.The court heard that Mr Gander received a copy of his police interview, which he mistakenly left behind at the accuseds' residence.Mr Gibson presented evidence to the court, including Google searches from D'Elio's phone for a dead body in burned car several days before media coverage of the death, as well as records from Stott's phone labelling the victim as Charlie dead dog Gander .As part of court evidence, the jury travelled from Melbourne to Shepparton, Bunbartha and Nathalia to view key locations in the case.A court appearance to schedule plea dates has been set for later this month.Posted Tue 15 Jul 2025 at 8:34amTuesday 15 Jul 2025 at 8:34amTue 15 Jul 2025 at 8:34am, updated Wed 16 Jul 2025 at 1:29amWednesday 16 Jul 2025 at 1:29amWed 16 Jul 2025 at 1:29amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesSurfers' alleged killers face Mexican court as document reveals cartel claimsTopic:HomicidePhoto shows Jake and Callum Robinson stand next to each other and smile.Trump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseBREAKINGPhoto shows A middle-aged man with grey-white hair wearing a grey T-shirt looks serious in front of a plain background.USAID returns Australian aid money after DFAT requestTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows USAID logoForcing companies to delete data would remove cybercrime 'honey pot', experts sayTopic:Cyber CrimePhoto shows A hooded man holds a laptop computer as cyber code is projected on him.Lachlan Young pleads guilty to murder of Hannah McGuireBREAKINGPhoto shows Sketch of a man with short hair, a white shirt and a black tie.Popular nowTrump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseBREAKINGPhoto shows A middle-aged man with grey-white hair wearing a grey T-shirt looks serious in front of a plain background.Lachlan Young pleads guilty to murder of Hannah McGuireBREAKINGPhoto shows Sketch of a man with short hair, a white shirt and a black tie.First stop Westfield: Salim Mehajer released from jailTopic:CrimePhoto shows Convicted criminal and former deputy mayor Salim Mehajer inside Westfield Parramatta today.Related topicsBenallaBunbarthaCourtsCrimeMelbourneSheppartonTop StoriesSurfers' alleged killers face Mexican court as document reveals cartel claimsTopic:HomicidePhoto shows Jake and Callum Robinson stand next to each other and smile.Breaking: Trump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseTopic:CourtsUSAID returns Australian aid money after DFAT requestTopic:Federal GovernmentForcing companies to delete data would remove cybercrime 'honey pot', experts sayTopic:Cyber CrimeBreaking: Lachlan Young pleads guilty to murder of Hannah McGuireTopic:CourtsJust InLarapinta Trail hikers urged caution after two rescues in one weekTopic:Hiking16m ago16 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:45amQueensland man charged with illegally importing hundreds of gun parts from USTopic:Law, Crime and Justice10m ago10 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:51amTrump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseBREAKING6m ago6 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:55amYouth camp founder Geoffrey Guest on trial for child sexual assaultTopic:Courts33m ago33 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:28amMore Just InBack to top Surfers' alleged killers face Mexican court as document reveals cartel claimsTopic:HomicidePhoto shows Jake and Callum Robinson stand next to each other and smile.

(ABC News: Dane Hirst)In short:The Northern Territory's police union president says a death or serious incident in custody is inevitable under the dangerous conditions inside the Palmerston police watch house. One recently released detainee said the women's cells were stained with period blood, while another said men had to s**t in front of everyone in cells of up to 16 people.The NT's prison population has soared to record highs in recent months, partly driven by the introduction of tougher bail laws.abc.net.au/news/nt-police-union-warns-of-death-custody-in-watch-house-conditions/105534016Link copiedShareShare articleThe Northern Territory's police union is warning a death or serious incident in custody is only a matter of time under dangerous conditions inside police watch houses.Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that this article contains the name and image of an Indigenous person who has died, used with the permission of their family.Their caution comes amid national attention on Aboriginal deaths in custody, after the NT coroner last week delivered her inquest findings into the 2019 police shooting of Kumanjayi Walker in Yuendumu. It also follows the recent deaths in custody of Warlpiri man Kumanjayi White in Alice Springs and a senior Kardu Rak Kirnmu elder at Royal Darwin Hospital. In a statement, the NT Police Association (NTPA) said 92 detainees were kept in the Palmerston police watch house on Monday, including 76 overflow corrections prisoners.NTPA president Nathan Finn says he's worried about the safety of police officers. (ABC News: Pete Garnish) This is officially out of control, NTPA president Nathan Finn said in a statement. It's not a matter of if, but when a serious custody incident occurs. The growing pressure on police comes just four months after the NT government promised to stop housing corrections prisoners at watch houses in Palmerston and Alice Springs.Corrections Minister Gerard Maley told parliament on March 18 that all prisoners had been moved out of the watch houses and into prisons in Holtze and Berrimah. Mr Finn told the ABC he was extremely concerned by another spike in corrections prisoners held inside watch houses. It's going to end up in a situation where a police officer is hurt, or an inmate in that facility is hurt or killed, he said. We've got no contingencies if someone gets violent. If someone has a mental health episode inside that facility, it's further placing our staff at unacceptable risk. Former detainees describe unhygienic conditionsFormer detainee Willis John Carlow, who was released on Tuesday after 10 days in the Palmerston watch house, said the conditions were horrible . We had to s**t in front of everyone and there was no space, just 10 other people — 16 other people — in one space, he said. You've got to eat while they're taking a s**t so it was pretty bad. Recently released detainees say the conditions inside Palmerston watch house are horrible . (ABC News: Hamish Harty)Another former detainee, who was also released on Tuesday but wished to remain anonymous, said the women's cells were stained with period blood. You've got eight girls crammed into one cell — girls who are on their periods and are not even being allowed to have showers, she said. We're all in this room with someone else's period blood all over the sheets and it's just pushed into a pile against the wall. She said the female inmates had created a barricade of mattresses around the cell's toilet for privacy from male correctional officers walking past. You've got one blocked toilet and then one toilet that barely works and we're supposed to be drinking water from bubblers on top of the toilet, she said. There was a pregnant woman in there who had stomach pains … and for two weeks in a row was asking to see medical [staff]. A Northern Territory Police spokesperson said all watch houses were managed through strict policy, procedures and instructions . The primary consideration in relation to people in police custody is the safety and welfare of the individual, the spokesperson said in a statement. All persons in custody are provided with basic necessities and are treated with respect. Backlog in courts contributing to chaosThe NT's prison population has soared in recent months, partly driven by the NT government's introduction of tougher bail laws.Data from the NT corrections department shows 2,847 prisoners were being held at correctional facilities on Tuesday, including 1,492 at Darwin Correctional Centre. About half of those prisoners are people on remand who have not yet been sentenced or found guilty. Inside the watch house at the police headquarters in Berrimah. (ABC News: Michael Donnelly)The overflow of prisoners is playing out in the courts. More than 185 court matters were listed between just two sitting judges at Darwin Local Court on Tuesday, giving judges about three minutes on average to process each matter. Mr Finn said the NT government had failed to support its tough-on-crime agenda with appropriate infrastructure to cope with rising prisoner numbers. This government continues to beat its chest about locking up more offenders, but it has utterly failed to plan for the consequences of its own policies, he said.Mr Finn also claimed overcrowding inside watch houses was preventing police officers from making arrests. We've heard from a number of members coming through that limitations in watch house space has led to arrests not being made, he said.Gerard Maley said individuals need to stop breaking the law . (ABC News: Pete Garnish)In a statement, Mr Maley said while the government was working to expand corrections infrastructure as quickly as possible , there was no alternative to currently keeping prisoners in watch houses. Police will continue arresting those who break the law, and corrections will continue expanding capacity to ensure those who are remanded or sentenced have a bed, he said. An extra 238 beds are expected to be operational at the Berrimah Correctional Centre by mid-August. That's in addition to the more than 500 new beds in Darwin and Alice Springs that the CLP has delivered since taking office last August. A department spokesperson said correctional staff have not operated out of the Palmerston police watch house since mid-March.LoadingPosted Tue 15 Jul 2025 at 8:19amTuesday 15 Jul 2025 at 8:19amTue 15 Jul 2025 at 8:19am, updated Tue 15 Jul 2025 at 9:17amTuesday 15 Jul 2025 at 9:17amTue 15 Jul 2025 at 9:17amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesSurfers' alleged killers face Mexican court as document reveals cartel claimsTopic:HomicidePhoto shows Jake and Callum Robinson stand next to each other and smile.Trump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseBREAKINGPhoto shows A middle-aged man with grey-white hair wearing a grey T-shirt looks serious in front of a plain background.USAID returns Australian aid money after DFAT requestTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto shows USAID logoForcing companies to delete data would remove cybercrime 'honey pot', experts sayTopic:Cyber CrimePhoto shows A hooded man holds a laptop computer as cyber code is projected on him.Lachlan Young pleads guilty to murder of Hannah McGuireBREAKINGPhoto shows Sketch of a man with short hair, a white shirt and a black tie.Popular nowTrump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseBREAKINGPhoto shows A middle-aged man with grey-white hair wearing a grey T-shirt looks serious in front of a plain background.Lachlan Young pleads guilty to murder of Hannah McGuireBREAKINGPhoto shows Sketch of a man with short hair, a white shirt and a black tie.First stop Westfield: Salim Mehajer released from jailTopic:CrimePhoto shows Convicted criminal and former deputy mayor Salim Mehajer inside Westfield Parramatta today.Related topicsCrimeDarwinJustice SystemPalmerstonPoliceTop StoriesSurfers' alleged killers face Mexican court as document reveals cartel claimsTopic:HomicidePhoto shows Jake and Callum Robinson stand next to each other and smile.Breaking: Trump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseTopic:CourtsUSAID returns Australian aid money after DFAT requestTopic:Federal GovernmentForcing companies to delete data would remove cybercrime 'honey pot', experts sayTopic:Cyber CrimeBreaking: Lachlan Young pleads guilty to murder of Hannah McGuireTopic:CourtsJust InLarapinta Trail hikers urged caution after two rescues in one weekTopic:Hiking16m ago16 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:45amQueensland man charged with illegally importing hundreds of gun parts from USTopic:Law, Crime and Justice10m ago10 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:51amTrump administration moves to unseal transcripts from Epstein caseBREAKING6m ago6 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:55amYouth camp founder Geoffrey Guest on trial for child sexual assaultTopic:Courts33m ago33 minutes agoFri 18 Jul 2025 at 1:28amMore Just InBack to top Surfers' alleged killers face Mexican court as document reveals cartel claimsTopic:HomicidePhoto shows Jake and Callum Robinson stand next to each other and smile.
